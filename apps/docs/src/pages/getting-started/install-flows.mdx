# Install Flows

Install the Flows SDK library via a NPM package manager.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @flows/js
```

Create Flows component and initialize it with your project ID.

```jsx
"use client";

import { init } from "@flows/js";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const Flows = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    init({
      // Insert your Flows Cloud projectId
      projectId: "xxxx",
    });
  }, []);

  return null;
};
```

Lastly don't forget to render the Flows component in the root of your application (`layout.tsx` or `App.tsx`). When that's done, you can start creating onboarding flows and starting them in your product.

This is the simplest way to install Flows. It only takes a few minutes.

Copy the snippet bellow and paste it within the `<head>` tag of your product - ideally right before the closing `</head>` tag.

When you're done, you can start using Flows by calling `flows.init()` anywhere in your code. You can find the `projectId` in your project settings.

```html
<script type="module">
  flows.init({
    // Insert your Flows Cloud projectId
    projectId: "xxxx",
  });
</script>
```

Once the snippet is installed, you can start creating onboarding flows and starting them in your product.

And then import it in your code. You can find the `projectId` in your project settings.

```js
import { init } from "@flows/js";

init({
  // Insert your Flows Cloud projectId
  projectId: "xxxx",
});
```

Once the library is installed, you can start creating onboarding flows and starting them in your product.

{/* ## Set up a proxy (optional) */}

{/* We recommend setting up a proxy to load flows from Flows Cloud, so they're less likely to be intercepted by ad blockers. There are several options for creating a reverse proxy, including Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify. */}
