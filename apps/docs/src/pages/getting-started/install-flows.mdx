# Install Flows

<Tabs items={["JS snippet (CDN)", "SDK library"]}>

 This is the simplest way to install Flows. It only takes a few minutes.

Copy the snippet bellow and paste it within the `<head>` tag of your product - ideally right before the closing `</head>` tag.

{/* TODO: How to make sure the version is always latest here? */}

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@flows/js@0.0.34/dist/cloud/index.global.js"></script>
```

When you're done, you can start using Flows by calling `window.Flows` anywhere in your code. You can find the `projectId` in your project settings.

```html
<script>
  window.FlowsJS.init({
    // Insert your Flows Cloud projectId
    projectId: "xxxx",
    // Optionally define local flows. Learn how at https://flows.sh/docs/SDK/local-flows TODO: fix link
    flows: [],
  });
</script>
```

Once the snippet is installed, you can start creating onboarding flows and launching them in your product.

Install the Flows SDK library via a package manager.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @flows/js
```

And then import it in your code. You can find the `projectId` in your project settings.

```js
import { init } from "@flows/js";

init({
  // Insert your Flows Cloud projectId
  projectId: "xxxx",
  // Optionally define local flows. Learn how at https://flows.sh/docs/SDK/local-flows TODO: fix link
  flows: [],
});
```

Once the library is installed, you can start creating onboarding flows and launching them in your product.

## Set up a reverse proxy (optional)

We recommend setting up a reverse proxy to load flows from Flows Cloud, so they're less likely to be intercepted by ad blockers. There are several options for creating a reverse proxy, including Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify.

{/* TODO: add simple article for reverse proxy process */}
