# Migrating to Flows 2

This guide details the changes and how to migrate your onboarding flows to Flows 2. Read the [full announcement](https://flows.sh/blog/flows-v2) on our blog.

![Workflows](/workflows/main.png)

<BetterCallout variant="warning">
  The old version of Flows will be shut down on **March 31, 2025**. Please ensure you migrate before
  this date. To ease the transition, Flows 1 usage will be free for everyone during this period.
</BetterCallout>

## Key changes

### Workflows

Flows 2 introduces [workflows](/workflows), enabling you to create complex, multi-step experiences across sessions and the entire user lifecycle. Workflows are more versatile than original flows and can function independently of user interaction.

### Flow is now a Tour

For step-by-step guides to specific tasks, use a [tour](/tours) within a workflow. Tours work similarly to old flows but offer [special features](/tours#tours-vs-workflows), making them ideal for linear user journeys.

### React-only support

Flows 2 is currently available only for React applications. A JavaScript SDK is in progress and will launch before Flows 1 is fully deprecated. If you are using a different framework, let us know at hello@flows.sh.

### Pricing changes

We’re transitioning from a “Monthly Started Flows” model to a “Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)” model. This means you’ll pay based on the number of users initialized in a given month, with unlimited workflows included. For full details, visit our [pricing page](https://flows.sh/pricing).

### Projects are deprecated

Flows 2 removes the concept of "projects". If you have projects in Flows 1, you can still access them to migrate your flows. Use [environments](/organization-setup/environments) or separate organizations to manage project isolation.

### Styling

Flows 2 does not support adding custom CSS in Flows Cloud. To customize components, use:

1. Custom components for full flexibility.
2. Built-in styles by extracting and modifying `index.css` from `@flows/react-components` package.

## How to migrate

### 1. Install the new SDK

Flows 2 requires the `@flows/react` package. The old `@flows/js` is deprecated and no longer updated.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @flows/react
```

Refer to the [getting started guide](/getting-started/quickstart) or [SDK documentation](/sdk/react) for setup details.

<BetterCallout variant="info">
  If you need to keep serving old flows in your application during the migration, keep the old
  `@flows/js` package installed.
</BetterCallout>

### 2. Use built-in components

In Flows 2, you can create custom UI components and use them in your workflows. To make the transition easier, we have created a set of built-in components. These components keep the most common use cases in mind, if you need different features, create your own custom components. To use the built-in components install the `@flows/react-components` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @flows/react-components
```

Then import and use the components in your app.

```tsx filename="layout.tsx" {2-4, 11-16}
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";
import * as components from "@flows/react-components";
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/react-components/tour";
import "@flows/react-components/index.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find in Settings > General
      environment="production" // Default environment
      tourComponents={{
        ...tourComponents,
      }}
      components={{
        ...components,
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

### 3. Add custom components

Flows 2 supports custom components for greater flexibility. Create components in your app, pass them to FlowsProvider, and use them in workflows. For more information, see the [custom components guide](/blocks/create-custom-components).
