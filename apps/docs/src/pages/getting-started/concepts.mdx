# Concepts

Get a basic understanding of Flows so you can set up your organization and start using Flows effectively.

## Basic concepts

### Organization

An organization is the container for all [workflows](/workflows), [environments](/organization-setup/environments), [users](/users), and [members](/organization-setup/manage-members). As a user, you can belong to multiple [organizations](/organization-setup/organizations) and switch between them using the dropdown in the top-left corner of the application. Logging into Flows means accessing your personal account, which can be associated with multiple organizations.

## Workflows

A workflow is a series of steps executed in a specific sequence, defined by the connections between [blocks](/blocks/library) and their conditions. In the workflow editor, you can add blocks, connect them, and configure their properties.

Workflows are version-controlled and can be published to individual [environments](/organization-setup/environments).

### Blocks

Blocks are the individual steps of a workflow. They can represent UI elements, logical steps, or actions. Each block has customizable properties that define its behavior and can be connected to other [blocks](/blocks/library) to form a workflow.

### Block properties

Block properties are the configurable fields available to editors when a block is added to a workflow. They map directly to the props defined in your components. For instance, a "banner block" might include properties like `title`, `description`, `button label`, `button link`, and `hide close button`.

### Block templates

Block templates are reusable UI components that allow you to create custom elements for [workflows](/workflows). They contain properties and instructions, giving editors the power to create custom workflows. Each template must correspond to a matching component in your application.

### Exit nodes

Exit nodes are connectors that allow [workflows](/workflows) to leave a block. They include logic to determine which path should be followed when exiting. For example, clicking a button might trigger an exit node that leads to another block.

### Paths

Paths connect [blocks](/blocks/library) in a workflow, starting from an exit node of one block and ending at an entry node of another. They define the sequence of the workflow.

## Tours

[Tours](/tours) are guided, step-by-step instructions designed to help [users](/users) complete a specific task or understand a feature within your application. They are typically used for onboarding new [users](/users) or highlighting new functionalities. Tours need to be part of a workflow.

## Slot

[Slots](/workflows/configure-blocks#slot-configuration) are places in your application where Flows can render components. They need to be [defined manually](/sdk/react#flowsslot) in your codebase and then they can be referenced in the workflow editor to render Slottable components.
