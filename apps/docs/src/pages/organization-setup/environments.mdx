# Environments

Separate Flows deployments for different stages of your development lifecycle.

[TODO: image]

## Overview

Environments allow you to manage [workflows](/workflows) across the entire development lifecycle, from local development to production. Each environment operates independently with its own:

- Active workflow versions and statuses
- Workflow analytics
- Users

You can create an unlimited number of environments.

## Create an Environment

[TODO: image of the environment page]

To create a new environment:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Environment**.
2. Enter a **unique key** for the environment. This key is used to identify the environment in the SDK.

## Edit an Environment

To modify an existing environment:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Environment**.
2. Update the **environment key** as needed.

<BetterCallout variant="warning">
  **Important:** If you update the environment key, ensure the key is updated in your SDK's `init`
  function to prevent service disruptions.
</BetterCallout>

## Using Environments

Each environment is associated with a unique key that links your application to the correct [workflows](/workflows). Include this key in your SDK setup:

```javascript
import { init } from "@flows/flows-sdk";

init({
  environment: "your-environment-key",
});
```
