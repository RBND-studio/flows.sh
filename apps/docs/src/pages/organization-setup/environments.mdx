# Environments

Separate Flows deployments for different stages of your development lifecycle.

![Environments list](/organization-setup/environments.png)

## Overview

Environments allow you to manage [workflows](/workflows) across the entire development lifecycle, from local development to production. Each environment operates independently with its own:

- Active workflow versions and statuses
- Workflow analytics
- Users

You can create an unlimited number of environments.

## Create an Environment

To create a new environment:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Environment**.
2. Enter a **unique key** for the environment. This key is used to identify the environment in the SDK.

## Edit an Environment

To modify an existing environment:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Environment**.
2. Update the **environment key** as needed.

<BetterCallout variant="warning">
  **Important:** If you update the environment key, ensure the key is updated in your SDK setup to
  prevent service disruptions.
</BetterCallout>

## Using Environments

Each environment is associated with a unique key that links your application to the correct [workflows](/workflows). Include this key in your SDK setup:

```tsx filename="layout.tsx" {7}
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find this in Settings > General
      environment="your-environment"
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```
