# Organizations

The first step to using Flows is to create an organization for your company.

## Overview

An organization is the home for all your [workflows](/workflows) and interactions in Flows. We recommend creating a single organization for your company and using [environments](/organization-setup/environments) to manage different deployments effectively.

When you create an organization, Flows automatically generates a default environment and language setting for you.

## Organization settings

To manage your organization, go to **Settings > Organization**.

Currently, any member of the organization can perform administrative tasks, such as:

- Adding or removing members
- Renaming the organization
- Deleting the organization
- Managing [billing](/organization-setup/billing) and [workflows](/workflows)

  **Note**: This approach will evolve as we introduce **member roles**, offering more granular
  permissions.
</BetterCallout>

### Delete an organization

Deleting an organization is permanent and includes the removal of all workflows and user data. You can delete an organization under **Settings > Organization > General**.

  **Important:** Before deleting an organization, cancel your subscription if you have a paid plan.

## Multiple organizations

Flows allows you to create multiple [organizations](/organization-setup/organizations) under a single account (e.g. tied to a specific email). If you are using Flows for multiple projects, we recommend creating a separate organization for each project.
