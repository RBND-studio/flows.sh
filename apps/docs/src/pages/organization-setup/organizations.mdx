# Organizations

An organization groups together all the projects and users in your company. It's the top-level entity in Flows. Here you manage your billing, users, and projects.

## Basics

### Organization settings

Currently any member of the organization can manage it. This means that any member can add or remove other members, change the organization name, or delete the organization, they can also manage the billing and the organization's projects. This will change in the future when we introduce member roles.

### Members

Members are users that have full access to the organization and any projects and flows in it. Your organization can have an unlimited number of members.

### Usage limit

When your organization is on a pay as you go plan, you can set the usage limit. When the limit is reached, all flows in the organization will be paused until the next billing cycle.
