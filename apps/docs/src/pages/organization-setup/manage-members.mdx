# Manage members

Invite and manage members of your organization.

![Organization switcher](/organization-setup/members.png)

You can manually invite and remove members from the organization settings page. Currently, everyone has the same permissions, but we will introduce roles in the future.

## Basics

### Invite members

Go to the **Organization settings** to invite new members to your organization. You can invite members by email. They will receive an email with an invitation link that expires after 7 days. Members have full access to the organization and any projects and flows in it.

### Join organization

The only way to join an organization is by invitation. When you receive an invitation to join an organization, click the link in the email to join the organization or log in to Flows and accept the invitation.

### Remove members

Any member of the organization can remove other members. Go to the **Organization settings** to remove a member. This will remove the member from the organization and they will lose access to all projects, and flows in it.
