## Overview

Flows automatically track how users interact with your flows to help you better understand how your users are engaging with your product. Use these insights to answer questions like:

- Are the flows useful to users?
- Are users getting stuck in the flows?
- Is something broken?

In the current state, you can see the last 30 days of data. Stay tuned for unlimited date ranges and more advanced analytics.

## Metrics

Flow analytics are in the early stages of development. The following metrics are currently available:

- **Starts**: How many times the flow was started.
- **Finishes**: How many times the flow was completed.
- **Exits**: How many times the flow was exited without completion.
- **Unique users**: How many unique users have started the flow.
- **Finish rate**: The ratio between finishes and starts.

In the future, you can expect:

- **Time spent**: How long users spend in the flow.
- **Error tracking**: See where and why users are getting stuck. We are currently testing this feature.
- **Funnel view**: See the performance of each step in the flow.
