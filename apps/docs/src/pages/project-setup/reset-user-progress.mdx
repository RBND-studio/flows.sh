# Reset user progress

You can reset progress of a user for a specific flow or all flows. This can be useful when you want to test the onboarding experience again or when you want to reset the progress for a specific user. You can reset the progress from the SDK or from the Flows cloud.

## Reset from SDK

To reset from SDK, make sure you [identify user first](/getting-started/identify-users). After the user is identified, you can call one of the following functions to reset the progress for the given `userId`.

### Reset single flow

To reset a specific flow for a user, you can call the `resetFlow` function with the flow human ID as an argument. To get the flow human ID, head over to the Settings tab of the flow in the Flows cloud.

```js
import { resetFlow } from "@flows/js";

// Reset single flow
resetFlow("my-flow");
```

### Reset all flows

To reset all flows for a user, you can call the `resetAllFlows` function.

```js
import { resetAllFlows } from "@flows/js";

// Reset all flows
resetAllFlows();
```

## Reset from Flows cloud

Similarly to the SDK, you can reset user progress from the Flows cloud.

### Reset all flows

To reset all flows for a user, head over to project settings in Flows cloud and enter the `userId` you want to reset the progress for and confirm the action. This will reset the progress for the given `userId` for all flows in the project.

### Reset single flow
