# Adding blocks

Learn how to add blocks to your workflow, the first step in building workflows.

[TODO: Insert illustrative image of adding a block]

## Overview

Blocks represent individual steps in a workflow, such as UI components, logic, or actions. Each block has configurable properties that determine its behavior. By connecting blocks through paths, you create a workflow.

## Add a block

To add a block to your workflow:

1. Click the **Add block** button located in the workflow toolbar at the bottom center of your screen.
2. Select a block from your block library.
3. Drag and drop the block to its intended position in the workflow editor.
4. Configure the block's properties in the settings panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

## Next steps

After adding blocks, you need to configure their properties and exit nodes. To learn more, see [Configuring blocks](./configuring-blocks.mdx).
