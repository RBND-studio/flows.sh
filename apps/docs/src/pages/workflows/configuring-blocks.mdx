# Configuring blocks

Customize block properties and their behavior.

[TODO: image]

## Overview

Blocks are individual steps of [workflows](/workflows), with configurable **properties** and **exit nodes**. Properties control the block's behavior and appearance, while exit nodes define the paths [users](/users) take after interacting with the block.

## Block name and description

Every block includes a name and description. The name is displayed in the workflow, while the description can be used to provide additional context about the block.

## Block properties

Block properties define a block's behavior and appearance. Access these properties in the block edit panel. Hover over a property name to view additional details, such as description, key, and type.

### Basic property types

Basic property types include:

- **String**: Input for string values.
- **Number**: Input for numeric values.
- **Boolean**: Checkbox for true/false values.
- **Select**: Dropdown menu to choose from predefined options.

### Slot configuration

If a block is slottable (i.e., designed to render within your application), additional slot-specific properties are available:

- **Slot ID**: Specifies the slot where the block will be rendered, as defined in your application.
- **Slot index**: Controls the rendering order when multiple [blocks](/blocks/library) share the same slot. Blocks with lower index render first.

### Page targeting

Use page targeting to determine where the block appears based on the URL. Supported options include:

- **Contains**: The block appears if the URL contains the specified value.
- **Does not contain**: The block appears if the URL excludes the specified value.
- **Matches regex**: The block appears if the URL matches the specified regular expression.

### Tour steps

For tour blocks, the **steps** property defines individual steps. Each step behaves like an individual block but transitions automatically when completed. You can:

- Add steps from your tour blocks library.
- Use built-in logic [blocks](/blocks/library), such as **`wait`** steps.

Built-in logic [blocks](/blocks/library) include:

- **`wait`**: Pause the tour until a user interacts with your application (e.g., clicking a button or navigating to a specific page).

#### Wait steps

Similarly to a **`wait`** step in a tour block, the **`wait`** property pauses the tour at a specific step until the user interacts with your application, such as clicking a button or navigating to a page. This property is exclusive to tour blocks.

## Exit nodes

Exit nodes are transitions triggered by user interactions with a block. To configure:

1. Click the **`+`** button beside the node key.
2. Select the destination block(s) to connect.

Users can transition to multiple blocks. If no exit nodes are connected, the workflow halts at the current block.

Each exit node can transition to multiple blocks. If no blocks are connected, the user instance stops at the current block. However, the workflows may continue if user is currently in other blocks.

## Block positioning

You can drag and drop blocks within the workflow editor to adjust their visual layout. Note that position changes do not affect block functionality.

## Removing a block

To remove a block:

1. Click the **`•••`** menu in the block's edit panel.
2. Select **Delete block**.

This removes the block and disconnects all associated paths.
