# Testing workflows

Learn how to test workflows in Flows.

[TODO: image]

## Overview

Testing [workflows](/workflows) is an essential step in ensuring your workflows run smoothly. Flows provides tools to validate and debug workflows before they are deployed.

## How to test a workflow

Follow these steps to test your workflow:

1. **Publish to test environment**: Publish the workflow in a test environment by clicking the **Publish** button in the workflow editor's top-right corner.
2. **Log in to your application**: Access your application in the test environment.
3. **Trigger the workflow**: Trigger the workflow by meeting the start block conditions. This may involve creating a new user, updating a user property, or performing another action that triggers the workflow.
4. **Verify behavior**: Confirm that the workflow executes as expected.

  To simplify testing, set the workflow frequency to `Every time`. This allows you to test
  repeatedly without needing additional changes.

## Restarting a workflow

If necessary, you can restart a workflow during testing. There are two methods to achieve this:

### 1. Publish a new version

When you publish a new version of a workflow, choose the **Restart all in-progress users** option. This resets the workflow for all [users](/users) currently in progress.

### 2. Restart a single user

To restart for a specific user without publishing a new version:

- Navigate to the user's profile.
- Click the **Reset progress** button next to the relevant workflow. Learn more about [user workflow states](/users/workflow-states).

## Debugging workflows

For insights into workflow execution for individual users, view their **Workflow state** and **Log** in the [user profile](/users).
