# Configure blocks

Customize block properties and their behavior.

![Configure blocks](/workflows/configure-blocks.png)

## Overview

Blocks are individual steps of [workflows](/workflows), with configurable **properties** and **exit nodes**. Properties control the block's behavior and appearance, while exit nodes define the paths [users](/users) take after interacting with the block.

## Block name and description

Every block includes a name and description. The name is displayed in the workflow, while the description can be used to provide additional context about the block.

## Block properties

Block properties define a block's behavior and appearance. Access these properties in the block edit panel. Hover over a property name to view additional details, such as description, key, and type.

### Basic properties

Basic properties allow you to customize the block's content, appearance, and behavior. These properties are defined by the block template and their types include:

- **String**: Input for string values.
- **Number**: Input for numeric values.
- **Boolean**: Checkbox for true/false values.
- **Select**: Dropdown menu to choose from predefined options.

### Slot configuration

When a block is slottable (i.e., designed to render within your application), additional slot-specific properties are available:

- **Slot ID**: Specifies the slot where the block will be rendered, as defined in your application.
- **Slot index**: Controls the rendering order when multiple [blocks](/blocks/library) share the same slot. Blocks with lower index render first.

These properties allow you to insert components into your application using predefined slots. Note that the slots need to be defined in your application before they can be used in Flows. See the [SDK documentation](/sdk/react#flowsslot) for more information.

### Page targeting

Page targeting allows you to determine where a block appears based on the current page [pathname](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/pathname). This is useful for displaying blocks on specific pages or sections of your application.

**Options:**

- **Page operator**: The operator that defines the pathname matching logic. Options include:
  - **Contains**: The block appears if the pathname contains the specified value.
  - **Does not contain**: The block appears if the pathname excludes the specified value.
  - **Matches regex**: The block appears if the pathname matches the specified regular expression.
- **Page values**: The value(s) used to match the pathname. For example, if the operator is set to **Contains**, the block appears when the pathname contains the specified value. You can add multiple values to match against (in that case the values are combined with an OR operator).

### Tour steps

For tour blocks, the **steps** property defines individual steps. Each step behaves like an individual block but is automatically connected to the previous and next steps via built-in `previous` and `continue` exit nodes and can be canceled through the `cancel` exit node.

When adding steps into a tour block, you can:

- Add tour specific blocks from your library.
- Use built-in wait steps to pause the tour until a user interacts with your application (e.g., clicking a button or navigating to a specific page).

#### Wait property

The wait property is automatically added to every step in the tour block. It allows you to pause the tour at a specific step until the user interacts with your application, such as clicking a button or navigating to a page.

**Options:**

- **Interaction**: The type of interaction that triggers the next step. Options include:
  - **Click**: Continues when the user clicks a specific element.
  - **Navigation**: Continues when the user navigates to a specific page.
  - **None**: The wait property is turned off, and the tour needs to be proceeded manually (e.g., through a button click).
- **Element**: The CSS selector of the element that triggers the next step. This options is available when the interaction is set to **Click**.
- **Page**: The URL of the page where the user needs to navigate, or the page where the element is located. This option is available for both **Click** and **Navigation** interactions. Configuration is described in the [page targeting](#page-targeting) section.

#### Wait step

Similarly to a **`wait`** property in a tour block, the **`wait`** step pauses the tour at a specific step until the user interacts with your application, such as clicking a button or navigating to a page. This step is built-in and can be added only to tour block steps.

**Options:**

- **Interaction**: The type of interaction that triggers the next step. Options include:
  - **Click**: Continues when the user clicks a specific element.
  - **Navigation**: Continues when the user navigates to a specific page.
  - **None**: The wait property is turned off, and the tour needs to be proceeded manually (e.g., through a button click).
- **Element**: The CSS selector of the element that triggers the next step. This options is available when the interaction is set to **Click**.
- **Page**: The URL of the page where the user needs to navigate, or the page where the element is located. This option is available for both **Click** and **Navigation** interactions. Configuration is described in the [page targeting](#page-targeting) section.

## Exit nodes

Exit nodes are transitions triggered by user interactions with a block. To configure:

1. Click the **`+`** button beside the node key.
2. Select the destination block(s) to connect.

Users can transition to multiple blocks. If no exit nodes are connected, the workflow halts at the current block.

Each exit node can transition to multiple blocks. If no blocks are connected, the user instance stops at the current block. However, the workflows may continue if user is currently in other blocks.

## Block positioning

You can drag and drop blocks within the workflow editor to adjust their visual layout. Note that position changes do not affect block functionality.

## Removing a block

To remove a block:

1. Click the **`•••`** menu in the block's edit panel.
2. Select **Delete block**.

This removes the block and disconnects all associated paths.
