# Publish workflows

Learn how to publish workflows in Flows.

## Overview

Workflows are version-controlled, allowing each environment to maintain a different active version. Publishing a workflow creates a new version, which can then be activated in specific [environments](/organization-setup/environments).

## Publishing a workflow

To publish a workflow:

1. Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner of the workflow editor.
2. Configure the following settings in the dialog that appears:

### Frequency

Define how often [users](/users) can enter the workflow:

- **Once**: Users enter the workflow only once.
- **Every time**: Users enter the workflow every time they meet the start conditions, provided they are not currently in the workflow.

### How to migrate active users

Determine what happens to users currently active in the workflow when a new version is activated:

- **End in-progress users**: Stops users who are currently active.
- **Restart in-progress users**: Restarts active users from the beginning.

These settings apply whenever the version is activated in an environment.

### Apply to environments

Choose which [environments](/organization-setup/environments) the new version should be applied to. If you're not ready to activate it in any environment, this can be done later from **Workflow detail > Environments**.

## Managing active versions

To manage active versions in environments:

1. Navigate to **Workflow detail > Environments**.
2. View the versions active in each environment, and manage environments as needed.

Each environment includes:

- **Workflow version**: The active version in that environment.
- **Status**: Indicates if the workflow is active.

To disable a workflow in an environment, toggle the **Status** checkbox.
