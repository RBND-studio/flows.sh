# Tour steps

Tour steps are tour-specific blocks from your block library.

![Tour steps](/workflows/tour-steps.png)

## Overview

Tours consist of tour-specific blocks from your block library. Each step behaves like a standard block but includes built-in connections to the previous and next steps through `previous` and `continue` exit nodes. A `cancel` exit node allows users to exit the tour at any step.

Tours also include a built-in wait step that pauses the tour until the user interacts with your application, such as clicking a button or navigating to a page.

## Custom steps

Custom steps are blocks from your block library added to a tour. When creating a [block template](/blocks/templates), you can define a block as a tour step, making it available for tours.

### Tour step exit nodes

Tour-specific blocks include built-in exit nodes to ensure proper behavior in tours:

- **`continue`**: Connects to the next step in the tour.
- **`previous`**: Connects to the previous step in the tour.
- **`cancel`**: Connects to the `cancel` exit node of the tour block.

To ensure compatibility, use these exit node keys in the underlying component.

### Wait property

The wait property is automatically added to each step in the tour block. When enabled, it pauses the tour at a specific step until the user performs a defined action, such as clicking a button or navigating to a page.

**Options:**

- **Interaction**: Defines the type of interaction required to proceed. Options include:
  - **Click**: Proceeds when the user clicks a specified element.
  - **Navigation**: Proceeds when the user navigates to a specific page.
  - **None**: Disables the wait property, requiring manual progression (e.g., via a button click).
- **Element**: The CSS selector of the element needed to be clicked to proceed (available when **Click** is selected).
- **Page**: Defines the target page or page for the interaction (available for both **Click** and **Navigation**). See the [page targeting](#page-targeting) section for configuration details.

## Wait step

The **wait** step functions like the `wait` property but is implemented as a standalone step within tour blocks. It pauses the tour until the user performs a defined interaction.

**Options:**

- **Interaction**: Defines the type of interaction required to proceed. Options include:
  - **Click**: Proceeds when the user clicks a specified element.
  - **Navigation**: Proceeds when the user navigates to a specific page.
  - **None**: Disables the wait property, requiring manual progression (e.g., via a button click).
- **Element**: The CSS selector of the element needed to be clicked to proceed (available when **Click** is selected).
- **Page**: Defines the target page or page for the interaction (available for both **Click** and **Navigation**). See the [page targeting](#page-targeting) section for configuration details.
