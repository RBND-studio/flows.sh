# Tooltip step

Tooltip is the most basic step. It is a small card that appears next to an element on the page. It can be used to draw attention to a specific element, provide more information, or guide the user through a process by point and click.

{/* ## Content

### Body

## Target

### Target element

Element that the tooltip points to.

### Placement

On which side of the target element the tooltip should be placed. Supported values: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, `top-start`, `top-end`, `right-start`, `right-end`, `bottom-start`, `bottom-end`, `left-start`, `left-end`

### Overlay

Highlights the target element with an overlay.

### Close on overlay click

Cancel the flow when the overlay is clicked. Only works when `overlay` is `true`.

### Hide arrow

Hide the arrow pointing to the target element.

### Scroll element

The element to scroll to when the tooltip is shown.

## Buttons

### Hide close

Hide the close button. Without the close button and overlay the user will not be able to close the tooltip

### Previous button

- Hide previous button
- Previous button label

### Next button

- Hide next button
  - Hide the next button. Watch out this option should be used with `footerActions` to provide a way to go to the next step or by controlling the flow programmatically with `nextStep()`. Otherwise the user will be stuck on the current step.
- Next button label
  - Text of the next and finish buttons.

## Footer actions

Customize the buttons show in the footer of the tooltip. You can add custom link, button to a target branch, or customize next and previous buttons.

```js
const step = {
  footerActions: {
    left: [],
    center: [],
    right: [
      {
        label: "Flows",
        href: "https://flows.sh",
        external: true,
      },
      {
        label: "Variant A",
        targetBranch: 0,
      },
      {
        label: "Continue",
        next: true,
      },
      {
        label: "Back",
        back: true,
      },
    ],
  },
};
``` */}
