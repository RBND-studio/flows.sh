# Wait step

Wait is a step that pauses the flow and waits for a user to finish specific action. You can wait for the user to click a button, navigate to a page, submit a form, etc.

In the demo below, after clicking **Continue** in the tooltip, the flow waits for the user to click the **Click me to continue** button before proceeding to the next step.

<Demo variant="wait" />

## Configuration

The wait step has the same properties as the wait options in the tooltip and modal. You can wait for the user to click a button, navigate to a page, submit a form, etc.
