# Wait properties

Wait properties can be customized in these step types:

- [Tooltip](/step-types/tooltip)
- [Modal](/step-types/modal)
- [Banner](/step-types/banner)
- [Wait](/step-types/wait)

The wait section allows you to wait for user interaction in the tooltip or modal before proceeding to the next step in the flow. To begin add a wait option to the step by clicking the **Add wait option** button in the **Wait** section. You can add multiple wait options where each option can we completed independently.

## Different types of wait options

There are currently five types of wait options. These are the same as the start options you can set for a flow.

### Location

The **Location** option proceeds when the user visits a specific page. We use only the location pathname for matching. For example, from the URL `https://acme.com/search=query=onboarding`, the `/search=query=onboarding` part is used.

When matching a location, the SDK uses regex. Entering `/onboarding` triggers a partial match. For exact matching, add the start `^` and end `$` symbols to the location, e.g., `^/onboarding$`.

Examples of possible locations:

- empty - matches any URL (this will not continue flow on its own but can be combined with other options)
- `/` - matches any URL (continues the flow on every page if no other options are set)
- `^/$` - matches the root page
- `/onboarding` - matches any URL with `/onboarding` in it
- `^/onboarding` - matches any URL starting with `/onboarding`
- `^/onboarding$` - matches exactly `/onboarding`
- `search=.+` - matches any URL with `search` query parameter and at least one character value

Location can be combined with other options to narrow down the wait conditions further.

### Click

The **Click** option continues a flow when the user clicks on a specific element. Use a [CSS selector](#how-to-pick-the-right-css-selector) that matches the element.

### Element on page

The **Element on page** option continues a flow when a specific element appears on the page/DOM. Use a [CSS selector](#how-to-pick-the-right-css-selector) that matches the element. This is useful to ensure the page is in a specific state before showing the flow, such as when a page loads or when there is an empty state.

### Input change

The **Input change** option continues a flow when the user changes the value of a specific input, like a text input in a form. Use a [CSS selector](#how-to-pick-the-right-css-selector) that matches the input element.

### Form submit

Similarly to **Input change**, the **Form submit** option continues a flow when the user submits a specific form. Use a [CSS selector](#how-to-pick-the-right-css-selector) that matches the form element.

## How to pick the right CSS selector

Selecting elements on the page requires the right CSS selector to avoid conflicts with other elements. Here are some tips:

- **Use unique classes or IDs**: If possible, use unique classes or IDs for the target element to ensure the selector matches only the desired element.
- **Use the most specific selector possible**: If unique classes or IDs aren't available, use the most specific selector possible to reduce conflicts.
- **Use browser developer tools**: Use browser developer tools to find the right selector. This [guide](https://www.scrapingbee.com/tutorials/how-to-extract-css-selectors-using-chrome/) can help you find the right CSS selector.
- **Test the selector**: After selecting a selector, test it in the browser's console to ensure it matches the correct element. Use `document.querySelector` for testing.

Examples of CSS selectors:

- `#my-button` - matches an element with the ID `my-button`
- `.my-class` - matches an element with the class `my-class`
- `button` - matches all button elements
- `input[type="text"]` - matches all text input elements
- `body > div > div > form > div:nth-child(2) > button` - matches a specific button element
