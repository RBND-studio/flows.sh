# Migrate to Flows

We understand that transitioning from your current solution to Flows can be a daunting task. We're here to help you every step of the way.

## Assisted migration

For a seamless transition, we will help you to migrate your existing onboarding solution to Flows. Our team will work with you to understand your current setup and guide you through the migration process. We will help you to:

- Set up your Flows account
- Recreate your existing onboarding in Flows
- Style onboarding elements to match your brand
- Test the onboarding experience
- Train your team on how to use Flows

This service is available to all customers who are looking to switch to Flows free of charge. To request an assisted migration, [contact us](/contact-us).

## Transition period

We understand that transitioning to a new tool can take time. To make the process easier, we offer a transition period where you can use Flows alongside your current solution. This will give you time to set up Flows, recreate your onboarding experiences, and test them before fully switching over.

To avoid double billing, any usage during the transition period (or until the end of your contract with your current provider) will be **free of charge**. To set up the transition period, [contact us](/contact-us).
