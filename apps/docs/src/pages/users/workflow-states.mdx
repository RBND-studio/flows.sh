# User workflow states

Inspect and manage user workflow states

[TODO: image]

## Overview

Every user you identify in Flows has a state for each workflow in your organization. You can inspect and update these states from the user detail page to troubleshoot or test workflows effectively.

## Understanding user workflow states

Each workflow state includes the following details:

- **Workflow** - the name of the workflow
- **Workflow status** - indicates if the workflow is active or its configuration is preventing the user from entering
- **User progress** - tracks the user’s progress within the workflow

### Workflow status

Workflow status can be one of the following:

- **Disabled** - workflow is disabled in the user's environment
- **Enabled** - workflow is enabled in the user's environment
- **No version assigned** - the workflow is enabled but lacks an assigned version in the user's environment

### User progress

User progress can be one of the following:

- **Not started** - user has not entered the workflow yet
- **In progress** - user is currently in the workflow
- **Finished** - user has completed or exited the workflow

## Reset user progress

Flows makes it easy to reset a user’s progress in a workflow. This can be particularly useful for testing updates or resolving user-specific issues.

To reset a user's progress in a workflow:

1. Navigate to the **Users** page in Flows.
2. Search for the user by their unique ID.
3. Open the **Workflows** tab in the user detail page.
4. Click **Reset progress** next to the workflow you want to reset.
