How to add and manage user properties

[TODO: image]

## Overview

User properties enable you to store additional information about your users as key-value pairs. These properties can be used to segment users.

## Default user properties

Flows automatically collects the following default user properties:

- **`updatedAt`** - timestamp when the user was last updated in Flows
- **`createdAt`** - timestamp when the user was created in Flows
- **`id`** - unique identifier of the user provided by you
- **`environment`** - environment (e.g., staging, production) associated with the user

## Custom user properties

Custom user properties are additional fields that you can use to store information about your users. You can define these properties using the Flows SDK or API.

### Property types

Custom user properties can be of the following types:

- **`string`**
- **`number`**
- **`boolean`**
- **`date`** - a date in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format

## Adding custom user properties

To add custom user properties, use the Flows SDK as shown below:

```javascript
import { init } from "@flows/flows-sdk";

init({
  environment: "your-environment-key",
  userProperties: {
    customProperty: "value", // Add your custom property here.
  },
});
```

## Reserved property names

The following property names are reserved by Flows and cannot be used for custom user properties:

- **`updatedAt`**
- **`createdAt`**
- **`id`**
- **`environment`**

## View assigned user properties

To view a user's properties:

1. Navigate to the **Users** page in Flows.
2. Search for the user by their unique ID.
3. View custom properties in the user detail page.
