# Event log

Track and view user activity in your environments

[TODO: image]

## Overview

Flows automatically track user events across your [environments](/organization-setup/environments), maintaining a detailed history of interactions. This includes workflow state changes and block transitions, helping you inspect and debug user behavior.

## Understanding the user log

Each event in the user log includes the following details:

- **Timestamp** - the exact date and time the event occurred
- **Event Type** - categorizes the event (e.g., block transition, workflow completion)
- **Event name** - identifies the workflow and block associated with the event

Event types include:

- **`workflow-entered`** - the user entered a workflow
- **`workflow-exited`** - the user completed or exited a workflow
- **`block-entered`** - the user entered a block
- **`block-exited`** - the user exited a block

## Example Use Case

Imagine a user reports an issue while navigating a workflow. By reviewing the **User Log**, you can:

1. Follow the user's path to identify where they encountered the issue.
2. Verify if the user completed expected transitions or encountered an error.
3. Use this data to optimize [workflows](/workflows) or address potential bottlenecks.
