# Flow frequency

Set how often the flow be shown to the user.

![Frequency form](/creating-flows/frequency.png)

Frequency currently supports:

- **Once**: The flow will be shown only once to the user. For this option to work, the user must be identified. This is the default option.
- **Every time**: The flow will be shown every time the user meets all flow conditions. We recommend using this option only for flows that are not intrusive and are not shown to the user too often.
