# Steps editor

Flows Cloud comes with a no-code steps editor that allows you to create and manage your steps in a visual way.

## Create a new step

To create a new step, click on the `Add step` button below the last step in the flow. This will create a new `Modal` step, to start editing it, click on the step to expand it.

### Pick a step type

The first thing you need to do is to pick a step type. This will define the behavior and the configuration of the step. The available step types are:

- [Tooltip](/step-types/tooltip)
- [Modal](/step-types/modal)
- [Wait](/step-types/wait)
- [Fork](/step-types/fork)

### Configure the step

Once you have selected the step type, you can start configuring the step. The configuration options will depend on the step type you have selected. For guides on how to configure each step type, check the **Step types** section in the sidebar or the links above.

### Configure branches (optional)

By default, after a step is completed, the flow will continue to the next step. When a following step is a fork you need to create ways for the flow to continue to all possible branches. When editing a tooltip or modal step, you can point to different branches when setting up the Footer buttons. When editing a wait step, you need to specify the target branch for each wait option.

## Create a fork

To create a fork, click on the `Add fork` button below the last step. This will create a new branch, to start editing it, click on the branch to expand it.

To make a fork work, you need to add branches to it. Do that by clicking on the `Add branch` button below the last branch in the fork step. This will create a new branch, to start editing it, click on the branch to expand it. Now you can start adding steps to the branch.

## Steps preview

Bellow the steps editor, you can see a preview of the flow. This will help you to visualize the flow and understand how the steps are connected. You can either navigate through the flow as a user would do, or click on the step cards above the viewbox to jump to a specific step.
