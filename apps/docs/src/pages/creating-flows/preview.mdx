# Preview flow

Test your flow before making it live.

![Flow preview button](/creating-flows/preview.png)

To preview a flow before making it live, click the `Preview` button in the top right corner of the flow editor. This will open up a modal where you need to enter the URL of the page where you want to test your flow. After that a new tab will open with the page you entered and the flow will start from there.

## Flow is not starting

If the flow is not starting, make sure that the page you entered is accessible from the internet and that the flow is not waiting for any input from the user. If nothing happens, double check that Flows are installed in the application you are trying to test the flow on.
