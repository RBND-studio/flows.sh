# Preview flow

Test your flow before making it live.

![Flow preview button](/creating-flows/preview.png)

To preview a flow before making it live, click the **Preview** button in the top right corner of the flow editor. This will open up a modal where you need to enter the URL of the page where you want to test your flow. After that a new tab will open with the page you entered and the flow will start from there.

Preview will always show you the latest version of the flow, regardless if it's published or in draft.

## Flow is not starting

1. Make sure the page you entered has Flows installed with correct Project ID.
2. Make sure the page domain is allowed in the Project settings.
3. Make sure the flow isn't stuck by clearing the browser local storage. {/* TODO: maybe we should think about better way of doing this */}
4. Check the browser console in the preview page for any errors.

{/* TODO: reflect the new SDK preview panel and how to use it */}
