# Preview flow

Test your flow before making it live.

![Flow preview button](/creating-flows/preview.png)

To preview a flow before making it live, click the **Preview** button in the top right corner of the flow editor. This will open up a modal where you need to enter the URL of the page where you want to test your flow. After that, a new tab will open with the page you entered and the flow will start from there.

Preview will always show you the latest version of the flow, regardless if it's published or in draft.

## Preview panel

When the flow is started in the preview, a panel will appear at the bottom of the screen. This panel will show you the current flow with the option to reset or end the preview.

If the preview panel is hiding a part of the page you are testing, move it to the other side of the screen by clicking the arrow button in the right corner of the panel.

## Flow is not starting

1. Make sure the page you entered has Flows installed with correct Project ID.
2. Make sure the page domain is allowed in the Project settings.
3. Check the browser console in the preview page for any errors.
