# Enable your flow

For your users to be able to see and interact with your flow, you need to make it live. Making your flow live will make the last published version of your flow available to your users.

## Publishing changes

Any changes you make to the flow will be saved automatically as a draft version of your flow. These changes will not be visible to your users until you publish them. This allows you to make changes to your flow and [preview them](/creating-flows/preview) before they are visible to your users. When you are ready to make your changes live, click **Publish changes**.

## Making your flow live

After you have published your changes, you can make your flow live by toggling the **Live** switch. When the switch is enabled, your flow is live and available to your users.
