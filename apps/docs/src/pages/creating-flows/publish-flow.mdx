# Publish a flow

When you are ready publish your flow and start guiding your users.

![Flow publishing options](/creating-flows/publish.png)

To publish a flow toggle the `Live` switch in top right-hand corner of the flow detail and then click `Publish changes`.

## Publishing changes

When your flow is live, any changes you make to the flow will not be visible to your users until you publish the changes. This allows you to make changes to your flow and test them before they are visible to your users. When you are ready to make your changes live, click `Publish changes`.
