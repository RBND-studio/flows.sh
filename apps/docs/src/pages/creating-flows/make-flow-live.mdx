# Make your flow live

When you have everything set up and are ready to start guiding your users, you can make your flow live. Making your flow live will make the last published version of your flow available to your users.

To make a flow live toggle the `Live` switch so that it is green. When the switch is green, your flow is live and available to your users.

## Publishing changes

Any changes you make to the flow will not be visible to your users until you publish the changes. This allows you to make changes to your flow and test them (by using `Preview`) before they are visible to your users. When you are ready to make your changes live, click `Publish changes`.
