# Creating custom components

Create custom [block templates](/blocks/templates) to add your own UI elements into [workflows](/workflows).

![Block templates](/blocks/template.png)

## Overview

Block templates are reusable UI components that allow you to add custom elements to [workflows](/workflows). Each block template requires a corresponding component in your application.

## Step 1: Create a UI component

Block templates rely on your custom UI components. First, create or reuse a component within your application. This component will be rendered when [users](/users) enter the block in a workflow.

### Create a component

In this guide, weâ€™ll build a marketing banner with the following customizable properties:

- Title
- Description
- Button label and link
- Option to hide a close button

If you would like to add different properties to your component, you can use the following types:

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- select (dropdown) - `"foo" | "bar" | "baz"`

```tsx filename="banner.tsx"
type Props = {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  buttonLabel: string;
  buttonLink: string;
  hideCloseButton?: boolean;
};

export const Banner = (props: Props): ReactNode => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>{props.title}</h2>
        {!props.hideCloseButton && <button>X</button>}
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>{props.description}</p>
        <a href={props.buttonLink}>{props.buttonLabel}</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Add exit node props

Now we will add exit node props that will allow Flows to react to user interactions with the block. Let's add `complete` and `close` props that will be called when the user clicks the button or the close button.

```tsx {7-8, 16, 20} filename="banner.tsx"
type Props = {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  buttonLabel: string;
  buttonLink: string;
  hideCloseButton?: boolean;
  complete?: () => void;
  close?: () => void;
};

export const Banner = (props: Props): ReactNode => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>{props.title}</h2>
        {!props.hideCloseButton && <button onClick={props.close}>X</button>}
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>{props.description}</p>
        <a onClick={props.complete} href={props.buttonLink}>
          {props.buttonLabel}
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

<BetterCallout variant="warning">
  Use only `complete` and `close` props for tour components, as they integrate directly with the
  Flows runtime.
</BetterCallout>

With added styling, the component should look like this:

<Banner
  title="Acme Conf 2024"
  description="Less than one week left to get free virtual tickets to Acme Conf, our global event."
  buttonLabel="Register"
  buttonLink="#"
/>

### Add component into the Flows provider

To make the component available to Flows, you need to add it to the `FlowsProvider` in your application.

```tsx filename="layout.tsx" {12}
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";
import { Banner } from "./banner";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id"
      environment="your-environment"
      // Add tour specific components here
      tourComponents={{}}
      components={{
        Banner,
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

## Step 2: Create a block template

Now that we have our component, we can create a block template in Flows. Navigate to **Block templates** and click **Create new template**.

A dialog will appear where you need to enter a name for the block template and select if the component is going to be used in a workflow or a tour.

### Specify component

To tell the Flows SDK which component to use, you need to enter the name of the component you defined in your application. In our case, it's `Banner`.

### Select if the component is slottable

If your component is intended to be rendered inside the application, you need to select the **Slottable** option. This will allow you to specify a slot id when adding the block to a workflow. In our case, the banner component is slottable.

### Define block properties

Block properties are the fields that your editors can customize when they add the block to a workflow. They are the same as the props you defined in your component. For our banner component, we'll add the following properties:

| Name              | Key             | Type    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Title             | title           | string  |
| Description       | description     | string  |
| Button label      | buttonLabel     | string  |
| Button link       | buttonLink      | string  |
| Hide close button | hideCloseButton | boolean |

Each property has:

- **Title** - the name of the property
- **Description** - a short description of the property for the editor (e.g. instructions)
- **Key** - the key that will be used to pass the value to the component
- **Type** - the type of the property

![Template properties](/blocks/template-properties.png)

### Add exit nodes

Exit nodes are the transitions that can be triggered when the user interacts with the block. For our banner component, we'll add two exit nodes:

- **`complete`** - when the user clicks the button
- **`close`** - when the user clicks the close button

The exit node has only a `key` field that needs to match the prop name in your component.

![Template exit nodes](/blocks/template-exit-nodes.png)

### Additional customization

You can also change the icon of your block template by clicking on the icon above the block template name.

### Save and publish

Once you've defined your properties and exit nodes, click **Publish changes** to make the latest version of the block template available to use in your [workflows](/workflows).

## Step 3: Add block to workflow

Now that we have our block template, we can add it to a workflow. Navigate to a workflow and click **Add block**. Select the block template you created and configure the properties.

![Template add to workflow](/blocks/template-add-to-workflow.png)

## Step 4: Finish the workflow

Once you've added the block to the workflow, you can connect it to other [blocks](/blocks/library) and paths to create a complete workflow. Users will see your custom component when they reach the block in the workflow.
