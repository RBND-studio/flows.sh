# Block library

Understand the building blocks that power your [workflows](/workflows).

[TODO: Image]

## Overview

Blocks are the individual steps connected by paths to create [workflows](/workflows). They can represent UI elements, logical steps, or actions. Each block has configurable properties, allowing for custom behavior. You can also create reusable custom [block templates](/blocks/templates) create custom UI components for workflows.

## Start blocks

Start blocks define the entry points for [users](/users) to begin a workflow. Multiple start blocks can be used in a single workflow to allow different entry conditions. Once a user enters a workflow, they will not re-enter until they exit it.

### Automatic start

Automatically triggers a workflow when specific conditions are met.

**Input:**

- **User properties conditions**: An array of conditions based on [user properties](/users/properties) that must be satisfied for a user to enter the workflow.

## Component blocks

Component blocks display custom UI elements within your application. They come in two types:

- **Floating**: UI components displayed over the application, such as modals and tooltips.
- **Inline**: UI components integrated within the application layout, such as banners and cards, added via slots.

To use component blocks, create a block template and integrate the corresponding component into your application. Default component blocks are available to help you get started.

## Logic blocks

Logic blocks manage workflow behavior. They can be used to define branching logic, conditions, and other rules.

### Filter

Filters [users](/users) based on specific conditions, allowing only those who match the criteria to proceed. Users who don't match stop at the block but may continue along other workflow paths if available.

**Input:**

- **User properties conditions**: An array of conditions [users](/users) must meet to pass through the block.

## End block

End blocks exit the workflow. When a user reaches an end block, the workflow is completed and marked as finished.
