# React SDK

The official Flows SDK for React.

## Installation

You can install the Flows React SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/react):

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @flows/react
```

### Built-in components

Flows comes with a set of built-in components that you can use in your workflows. You can install the `@flows/react-components` package [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/react-components):

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @flows/react-components
```

Then, import and use the components in your app:

```tsx filename="layout.tsx" {2, 9-14}
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";
import { tourComponents, components } from "@flows/react-components";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find this in Settings > General
      environment="production" // Default environment
      tourComponents={{
        ...tourComponents,
      }}
      components={{
        ...components,
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

## Usage

The SDK provides a `FlowsProvider` component that you can use to wrap your app. Initialize it with your organization ID and environment key, which you can find in the **Settings > General** and **Settings > Environments** sections of the Flows dashboard.

```tsx filename="layout.tsx"
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find this in Settings > General
      environment="production" // Default environment
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

FlowsProvider accepts the following props:

| Name             | Type     | Required | Notes                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `organizationId` | `string` | Yes      | Your organization ID. Find this in **Settings > General**.                                                       |
| `environment`    | `string` | Yes      | The environment key. Find this in **Settings > Environments**.                                                   |
| `components`     | `object` | No       | Custom components to use in your workflows.                                                                      |
| `tourComponents` | `object` | No       | Custom tour components to use in tour blocks.                                                                    |
| `userId`         | `string` | No       | Unique user ID. If no ID is provided, all users will be treated as one.                                          |
