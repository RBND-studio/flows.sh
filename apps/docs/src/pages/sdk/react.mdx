The SDK provides a `FlowsProvider` component that you can use to wrap your app. Initialize it with your organization ID and environment key, which you can find in the **Settings > General** and **Settings > Environments** sections of the Flows dashboard.

```tsx filename="layout.tsx"
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find this in Settings > General
      environment="production" // Default environment
      userId="your-user-id" // Identify the user
      components={{}}
      tourComponents={{}}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

The `FlowsProvider` accepts the following props:

| Name             | Type     | Required | Notes                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `organizationId` | `string` | Yes      | Your organization ID. Find this in **Settings > General**.                                                       |
| `environment`    | `string` | Yes      | The environment key. Find this in **Settings > Environments**.                                                   |
| `userId`         | `string` | Yes      | Unique ID for identifying the user.                                                                              |
| `components`     | `object` | Yes      | Custom components to use in your workflows.                                                                      |
| `tourComponents` | `object` | Yes      | Custom tour components to use in tour blocks.                                                                    |
| `userProperties` | `object` | No       | Object with custom [user properties](/users/properties). Values can be `string`, `number`, `boolean`, or `date`. |
| `apiUrl`         | `string` | No       | Custom API URL useful when using proxy to send Flows requests through your own domain.                           |

### FlowsSlot

The `FlowsSlot` is used to create Slots in your app where you can insert components using Workflows. Learn more about using Slots in the Flows editor [here](/workflows/configure-blocks#slot-configuration).

```tsx
import { FlowsSlot } from "@flows/react";

const Sidebar = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My app</h1>
      <FlowsSlot id="my-slot" placeholder={<BannerPlaceholder />} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

| Name          | Type        | Required | Notes                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`          | `string`    | Yes      | The Slot ID used to refer to the slot when creating workflows.     |
| `placeholder` | `ReactNode` | No       | The component to render when no component is inserted in the slot. |

### Custom components

The `FlowsProvider` component accepts `components` and `tourComponents` props that you can use to provide custom components to use in your workflows.

### Built-in components

Flows comes with a set of built-in components that you can use in your workflows. You can install the `@flows/react-components` package [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/react-components):

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @flows/react-components
```

Then, import and use the components in your app:

```tsx filename="layout.tsx" {2-4, 11-16}
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";
import * as components from "@flows/react-components";
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/react-components/tour";
import "@flows/react-components/index.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find this in Settings > General
      environment="production" // Default environment
      userId="your-user-id" // Identify the user
      tourComponents={{
        ...tourComponents,
      }}
      components={{
        ...components,
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```
