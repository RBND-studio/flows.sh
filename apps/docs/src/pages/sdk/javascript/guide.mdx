# JavaScript SDK

The official Flows SDK for JavaScript.

![Flows JavaScript SDK](/sdk/javascript.png)

Flows JS SDK is a lightweight library that allows you to integrate Flows into any application that runs JavaScript. Similar to our [React SDK](/sdk/react), this SDK includes a components package to simplify getting started with Flows in your application.

## Installation

You can install the Flows JavaScript SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js):

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @flows/js
```

## Usage

  implementation examples.

### Initializing the SDK

Use the `init` function to initialize the SDK with your organization ID and environment key, which you can find in the **Settings > General** and **Settings > Environments** sections of the Flows dashboard.

```js filename="main.js"
import { init } from "@flows/js";

init({
  organizationId: "your-organization-id", // Found in Settings > General
  environment: "production", // Default environment
  userId: "your-user-id", // Identify the user
});
```

Refer to the [init function documentation](./reference.mdx#init) for details on configurable options.

### Integrating with UI frameworks / libraries

The SDK includes utilities for rendering blocks in JavaScript applications. You can implement block rendering using these methods:

- [`addFloatingBlocksChangeListener`](./reference.mdx#addfloatingblockschangelistener): Listen for floating block changes.
- [`addSlotBlocksChangeListener`](./reference.mdx#addslotblockschangelistener): Listen for changes to slot blocks.
- [`getCurrentFloatingBlocks`](./reference.mdx#getcurrentfloatingblocks): Retrieves current floating blocks.
- [`getCurrentSlotBlocks`](./reference.mdx#getcurrentslotblocks): Retrieves current slottable blocks.

#### Rendering floating blocks

Hereâ€™s a high-level example of rendering floating blocks using a pseudo UI library. Since `@flows/js` is designed to work with any JavaScript UI library/framework the example is in a generic code that illustrates how to use it with concepts that are common in most UI frameworks.

```js filename="main.js"
import { addFloatingBlocksChangeListener } from "@flows/js";

// Pseudo UI library reactive state for managing blocks
const blocksState = uiState();

const dispose = addFloatingBlocksChangeListener((blocks) => {
  blocksState.set(blocks);
});

// Call `dispose` when you want to stop listening to the changes and avoid memory leaks
dispose();

// Define your components and tour components
const components = { ... }
const tourComponents = { ... }

// Pseudo UI library code that renders the blocks
const render = () => {
  return blocksState.map(block => {
    if(block.type === "component") {
      const Component = components[block.component]
      return <Component {...block.props} />
    }

    if(block.type === "tour-component") {
      const TourComponent = tourComponents[block.component]
      return <TourComponent {...block.props} />
    }
  })
}
```

#### Slot rendering

Rendering slot-specific blocks can be done by creating a reusable `FlowsSlot` component. This component listens for changes to slot blocks in a specific slot ID and renders the blocks accordingly.

```js filename="flows-slot.js"
import { addSlotBlocksChangeListener } from "@flows/js";
// Import your components that we defined earlier
import { components, tourComponents } from "@/my-flows-components";

// Pseudo UI library reactive state
const mySlotBlocksState = uiState();

const dispose = addSlotBlocksChangeListener(
  // Pass a `slotId` prop to the component
  props.slotId,
  (blocks) => {
    blocksState.set(blocks);
  },
);
// Call `dispose` when you want to stop listening to the changes and avoid memory leaks
dispose();

// Pseudo UI library code that renders slot
const FlowsSlotRender = () => {
  // Without any blocks, render optional placeholder
  if (mySlotBlocksState.length === 0) return props.placeholder ?? null;

  return mySlotBlocksState.map((block) => {
    if (block.type === "component") {
      const Component = components[block.component];
      return <Component {...block.props} />;
    }

    if (block.type === "tour-component") {
      const TourComponent = tourComponents[block.component];
      return <TourComponent {...block.props} />;
    }
  });
};
```

### Using `@flows/js-components`

To simplify implementation, you can use the `@flows/js-components` package, which provides pre-built components and utilities for block rendering.

You can install the Flows JavaScript Components SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js-components):

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @flows/js-components
```

Then setup the slot components and render function for the floating blocks. Rendering of slot blocks will be handled by the [`<flows-slot>`](#flows-slot) element.

```js filename="main.js"
import { init, addFloatingBlocksChangeListener } from "@flows/js";
import { render, updateSlotComponents } from "@flows/js-components";
import * as components from "@flows/js-components/components";
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/js-components/tour-components";

// Import the styles or copy them to your project and <link> them in your HTML
import "@flows/js-components/index.css";

init({ ... })
updateSlotComponents({ components, tourComponents })
const dispose = addFloatingBlocksChangeListener((blocks) => {
  render({ blocks, components,tourComponents });
});
// Call `dispose` when you want to stop listening to the changes to avoid memory leaks
dispose()
```

You can then use custom `<flows-slot>` HTML element with optional placeholder content anywhere in your HTML document to render slottable blocks.

```html filename="page.html"
<body>
  <!-- ... -->
  <flows-slot data-slot-id="my-slot">
    <!-- Optionally you can pass one child element with `data-placeholder` attribute -->
    <div data-placeholder>
      <p>Optionally pass placeholder content here</p>
    </div>
  </flows-slot>
  <!-- ... -->
</body>
```
