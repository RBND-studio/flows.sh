## Overview

Blocks define the behavior of a workflow. They can represent UI elements, logical steps, or actions. Each block has customizable properties that define its behavior and can be connected to other blocks to form a workflow.

The connections between blocks (paths) determine how users navigate through the process.

## Block types

In Flows there are different types of blocks based on their functionality.
