![Workflows](/workflows/main.png)

The old version of Flows will be shut down on **March 31, 2025**. Please ensure you migrate before
this date. To ease the transition, Flows 1 usage will be free for everyone during this period. Read the [full announcement](https://flows.sh/blog/flows-v2) on our blog.

## Key changes

### Workflows

Flows 2.0 introduces [workflows](/workflows/overview), enabling you to create complex, multi-step experiences across sessions and the entire user lifecycle. Workflows are more versatile than original flows and can function independently of user interaction.

### Flow is now a Tour

For step-by-step guides to specific tasks, use a [tour](/tours) within a workflow. Tours work similarly to old flows but offer [special features](/tours#tours-vs-workflows), making them ideal for linear user journeys.

### Pricing changes

We’re transitioning from a “Monthly Started Flows” model to a “Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)” model. This means you’ll pay based on the number of users that experience a workflow in a given month, with unlimited workflows included. For full details, visit our [pricing page](https://flows.sh/pricing).

### Projects are deprecated

Flows 2.0 removes the concept of "projects". If you have projects in Flows 1, you can still access them to migrate your flows. Use [environments](/environments) or separate organizations to manage project isolation.

### Styling

Flows 2.0 does not support adding custom CSS in Flows Cloud. To customize components, use:

1. Custom components for full flexibility.
2. Built-in styles by extracting and modifying `index.css` from `@flows/react-components` package.

## How to migrate

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install the new SDK

Intall `@flows/react` package or update `@flows/js` to the latest version.

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<React16 />} title="React" href="/react/installation">
    Flows SDK purpose-built for applications built with React.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<JavaScript16 />} title="JavaScript" href="/javascript/installation">
    Flows SDK for integrating with any JavaScript framework.
  </Card>
</Cards>

</Step>

<Step>

### Use built-in components

In Flows 2.0, you can create custom UI components and use them in your workflows. To make the transition easier, we have created a set of built-in components. These components keep the most common use cases in mind, if you need different features, create your own custom components. To use the built-in components install the `@flows/react-components` or `@flows/js-components` package.

```package-install
npm install @flows/react-components
```

Then import and use the components in your app.

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";
import * as components from "@flows/react-components"; // [!code highlight]
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/react-components/tour"; // [!code highlight]
import "@flows/react-components/index.css"; // [!code highlight]

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find this in Settings > General
      environment="production" // Default environment
      userId="your-user-id" // Identify the user
      tourComponents={{
        ...tourComponents, // [!code highlight]
      }}
      components={{
        ...components, // [!code highlight]
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Add custom components

Flows 2.0 supports custom components for greater flexibility. Create components in your app, pass them to FlowsProvider, and use them in workflows. For more information, see the [custom components guide](/create-custom-components).
