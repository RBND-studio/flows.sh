## Overview

Users are individuals who you identify inside Flows. Each user has a unique identifier and can experience [workflows](/workflows/overview) inside your app. Users are scoped on environment level, meaning that a user with the same ID will have individual user profile and workflow states in each environment.

The **User detail** page allows you to:

- [View user properties](/users/properties)
- [View event log](/users/log)
- [Inspect and manage user workflow states](/users/workflow-states)
- [Reset user progress](/users/workflow-states#reset-user-progress)

## Add a user

Users are automatically added to Flows when they are initialized in your application. When you identify a user, Flows creates a user profile based on the provided user ID. You can't add users manually.

## Remove a user

Currently users can't be removed from Flows. If you need to remove a user, contact us at support@flows.sh
