<Callout>
  Page targeting is available on some logic blocks and all components. The Flows SDK handles the
  page targeting logic, so you don't need to implement it in your components.

## Overview

Page targeting allows you to determine where a block appears based on the current page [pathname with query parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/pathname#pathname_with_query_parameters). This is useful for displaying blocks on specific pages or sections of your application. In [wait step](/blocks/tour-block#wait-step) and [wait properties](/blocks/block-properties/wait), page targeting can be used to pause the workflow until the user navigates to a specific page or does a specific action on the desired page.

## Options

- **Page operator**: The operator that defines the pathname matching logic. Options include:
  - **Contains**: The block appears if the pathname contains the specified value.
  - **Does not contain**: The block appears if the pathname excludes the specified value.
  - **Equals**: The block appears only if the pathname matches the specified value exactly.
  - **Does not equal**: The block appears if the pathname does not match the specified value exactly.
  - **Start with**: The block appears if the pathname starts with the specified value.
  - **Does not start with**: The block appears if the pathname does not start with the specified value.
  - **End with**: The block appears if the pathname ends with the specified value.
  - **Does not end with**: The block appears if the pathname does not end with the specified value.
  - **Matches regex**: The block appears if the pathname matches the specified regular expression.
- **Page values**: The value(s) used to match the pathname. For example, if the operator is set to **Contains**, the block appears when the pathname contains the specified value. You can add multiple values to match against (in that case the values are combined with an OR operator).

## Examples

| Goal | Operator | Value |
| ---- | -------- | ----- |
| Show on the dashboard page | Equals | `/dashboard` |
| Show on any settings page | Starts with | `/settings` |
| Show everywhere except billing | Does not contain | `/billing` |
| Match dynamic user pages | Matches regex | `/users/[^/]+/profile` |
| Show on multiple specific pages | Contains (multiple values) | `/dashboard`, `/home` |
