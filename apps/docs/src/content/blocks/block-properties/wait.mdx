<Callout>Wait properties are only available in [tour steps](/blocks/tour-block).</Callout>

## Overview

The wait property is automatically added to each step in the [tour block](/blocks/tour-block). When enabled, it pauses the tour at a specific step until the user performs a defined action, such as clicking a button or navigating to a page.

## Options

- **Interaction**: Defines the type of interaction required to proceed. Options include:
  - **User navigates to a page**: Proceeds when the user navigates to a specific page.
  - **User clicks on an element**: Proceeds when the user clicks a specified element.
  - **Delay**: Proceeds when the specified amount of time has passed.
  - **Element is on the page** – Proceeds when a specific element is present in the DOM (use CSS selector).
  - **Element is not on the page** – Proceeds when a specific element is not present in the DOM (use CSS selector).
  - **None**: Disables the wait property, requiring manual progression (e.g., via a button click).
- **Element**: The CSS selector of the element needed to be clicked to proceed (available when **User clicks on an element** is selected).
- **Page**: Defines the target page or page for the interaction (available for both **User clicks on an element** and **User navigates to a page**). See the [page targeting](/blocks/block-properties/page-targeting) section for configuration details.
