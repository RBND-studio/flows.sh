## Overview

User properties fields allows you to target users based on their attributes. You can add multiple [user properties](/users/properties) to target users based on their attributes, in that case the properties are combined with an AND operator. User properties are only available in built-in logic blocks.

## Options

- **Property name**: The user attribute to target.
- **Data type**: The data type of the user attribute. See [supported types](/users/properties#property-types).
- **Operator**: The operator to use when comparing the user attribute value.
- **Values**: The value(s) to compare against the user attribute. You can add multiple values to match against (in that case the values are combined with an OR operator).

## How conditions work

- **Multiple conditions** on the same block use AND logic — the user must match all conditions to pass.
- **Multiple values** within a single condition use OR logic — the user must match at least one value.

For example, `plan equals pro OR enterprise` AND `createdAt greater than 2025-01-01` matches users who are on either the Pro or Enterprise plan and signed up after January 2025.

## Where user properties are used

User property conditions appear in the following blocks:

- **[Automatic start](/blocks/start-blocks/automatic-start)** — controls who can enter a workflow.
- **[Manual start](/blocks/start-blocks/manual-start)** — controls who can enter a manually-triggered workflow.
- **[Filter](/blocks/logic-blocks/filter)** — controls who can continue within a workflow.
