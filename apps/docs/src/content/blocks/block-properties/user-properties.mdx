## Overview

User properties fields allows you to target users based on their attributes. You can add multiple [user properties](/users/properties) to target users based on their attributes, in that case the properties are combined with an AND operator. User properties are only available in built-in logic blocks.

## Options

- **Property name**: The user attribute to target.
- **Data type**: The data type of the user attribute. See [supported types](/users/properties#property-types).
- **Operator**: The operator to use when comparing the user attribute value.
- **Values**: The value(s) to compare against the user attribute. You can add multiple values to match against (in that case the values are combined with an OR operator).
