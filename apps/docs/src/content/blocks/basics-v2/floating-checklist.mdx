## Overview

The Floating Checklist component provides users with a persistent, floating widget that contains a structured list of tasks or instructions to complete within your application. It is designed for multi-step, non-linear activation flows where users can complete tasks in any order and return to them over time.

Unlike other components, the Floating Checklist renders as a widget button anchored to a corner of the screen and persists across pages based on page targeting rules. Unlike Tours, it does not enforce a sequence. Instead, it acts as an activation hub that can launch other blocks such as Tours, Tooltips, or Modals.

## Installation

To integrate the Checklist component into your application, follow the steps described in the [library installation guide](/blocks/basics-v2/overview#installation).

## Usage

### Start a Tour with Checklist

Checklist items can trigger actions that open other blocks or navigate users to specific pages in your application. To start a tour from a checklist item, assign a Tour block to the primary or secondary button action of the item. When the user clicks the button, the Tour will start.

If you want the checklist item to be marked as completed only after the Tour finishes, configure the `Completed` state memory to be triggered when exiting the Tour block.

### Marking Items as completed

By default, checklist items are marked as completed when the user clicks the primary button. For more advanced use cases, you can configure the `Mark as completed` property of each checklist item to be marked as completed when the user exits a specific block in your workflow. This property uses the [State memory](/blocks/block-properties/state-memory) feature to determine when an item should be marked as completed.

### Example Workflow

A typical Checklist-driven workflow looks like this:

1. Floating Checklist appears on the dashboard
2. User clicks the item "Invite teammate"
3. Workflow transitions into a Tour block
4. User finishes the Tour
5. Tour exit updates the Completed state memory
6. Checklist item gets marked as completed

To see a full working example, check out the [Checklist example workflow](https://flows.sh/examples/floating-checklist) in the Flows examples.
