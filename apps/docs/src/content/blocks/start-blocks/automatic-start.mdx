![Start block](/blocks/start.png)

## Overview

Start blocks determine which users can enter a workflow and define their starting point. They enable you to target a specific set of users for a given workflow. Multiple start blocks can be used within a single workflow to accommodate different entry conditions. Once a user enters a workflow, they will not be allowed to re-enter until they have exited.

## Input

A start block uses [user property](/users/properties) conditions to control how users enter the workflow. These conditions allow you to evaluate users properties to determine whether user should qualify to enter the workflow. For example, you might filter users who signed up before a certain date.

User property conditions are specified as an array where all conditions must be met for a user to enter. Each condition includes the following attributes:

- **Property name**: The key of the user property to evaluate (eg. `createdAt`).
- **Data type**: The type of the user property. Options include `string`, `number`, `boolean`, or `date`.
- **Operator**: The operator used for the comparison. The available operators depend on the data type.
- **Values**: The comparison values. When multiple values are specified, they are evaluated using the `OR` operator.

## Multiple start blocks

You can use multiple start blocks within a single workflow to establish different entry conditions. Remember, once a user enters a workflow through any start block, they cannot re-enter until they exit.

## Examples

### Target only new users

Add a condition where `createdAt` is **greater than** your launch date. Only users who signed up after that date will enter the workflow. See the full guide: [How to target only new users](/guides/how-to-target-only-new-users).

### Target users on a specific plan

Add a condition where `plan` **equals** `pro`. Only users on the Pro plan will see the workflow.

### Combine multiple conditions

All conditions use AND logic — the user must match every condition. For example, `plan equals pro` AND `createdAt greater than 2025-01-01` targets Pro users who signed up after January 2025.
