## Overview

Action blocks perform actions in response to workflow events. Unlike logic blocks that control the flow of a workflow, action blocks interact with other parts of the system, such as starting other workflows.

## Action blocks

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<WorkflowTrigger16 />}
    title="Workflow trigger"
    href="/blocks/action-blocks/workflow-trigger"
  >
    Starts another workflow by entering a specified manual start block.
  </Card>
</Cards>
