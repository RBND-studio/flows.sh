![Delay block](/blocks/delay.png)

## Overview

The **Delay** block pauses the path that enters it for a set duration before continuing to the next block. Use it to space out messages, follow up after onboarding, or stop workflows after a fixed period.

Example: show a product tour today, then send extra tips one week later.

## How it works

- The block pauses **only the path that passes through it**. Other paths in the workflow continue normally.
- Delays are evaluated **once per minute**. The real delay may be up to **59 seconds longer** than configured. If you need precise timing during an interaction, use the [Wait step](/blocks/tour-block#wait-step) in the Tour block.
- A delay can be set to **0**. In that case, users pass through instantly.
- If a user leaves the workflow while waiting, the delay is **cancelled** and they will not continue.

## Billing impact (MTUs)

The Delay block requires tracking users over time and counts as an **active block**.

A user counts as an MTU:

- When they **enter** the Delay block

A user is **not counted again**:

- While waiting in the block
- When exiting the block

## Exit nodes

| Node        | Description                                                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `completed` | Triggered when the delay finishes and the user continues to the connected blocks. |

## Examples

### Stop a workflow after a week

In this example, the user starts a welcome product tour. To prevent them from returning to the tour after a week of inactivity without context, connect a Delay block to the Start block with a 7-day delay, then connect the Delay block to an End block. The workflow will automatically stop 7 days after the user enters it, ensuring outdated or irrelevant content is not shown.

### Space out tips over time

In this example, a user enters a workflow and sees a tip. After they see the tip, they are delayed for 3 days before they see the next tip. This allows you to space out content over time, instead of overwhelming users with too much information at once.
