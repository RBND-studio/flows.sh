## Overview

Logic blocks define branching logic, conditions, and other rules that control the flow of a workflow. They can be used to filter users, apply conditions, or perform other logical operations.

## Logic blocks

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<Filter16 />} title="Filter" href="/blocks/logic-blocks/filter">
    Lets through only users that meet specific conditions.
  </Card>
