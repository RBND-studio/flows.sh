![Filter block](/blocks/filter.png)

## Overview

The Filter block lets through only users that meet specific conditions, allowing you to branch workflows based on user properties. Users that don't match the conditions are stopped and won't continue to the next block. However, if they have another active block in the workflow, the workflow won't be exited.

## Input

The Filter block evaluates an array of [user property](/blocks/block-properties/user-properties) conditions. The user must meet **all** conditions to pass through the block.

## Exit nodes

| Node      | Description                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `matched` | Triggered when the user meets all conditions.            |

## Examples

### Show a feature announcement only to paid users

Add a Filter block after the Start block with the condition `plan equals paid`. Only users on a paid plan will continue to the announcement block. Free users stop at the filter and remain in the workflow without seeing the announcement.

### Branch an onboarding workflow by role

Use two Filter blocks after a Start block — one with `role equals admin` and another with `role equals member`. Each filter leads to a different set of blocks, giving admins and members a tailored onboarding experience.

## Filter vs. Start block

Both the [Start block](/blocks/start-blocks/automatic-start) and the Filter block use user property conditions. The difference is:

- **Start block**: Controls who can **enter** a workflow.
- **Filter block**: Controls who can **continue** within a workflow that they've already entered.
