## Overview

Tours consist of tour-specific blocks from your block library. Each tour step functions like a regular block but comes with built-in features that help with creating step-by-step linear guides.

## Tour steps

The steps property in a tour block defines the individual steps. Each step acts as an independent block but is automatically linked to the previous and next steps through the built-in `previous` and `continue` exit nodes. Users can exit the tour at any step using the `cancel` exit node.

When adding steps into a tour block, you can add:

- Tour specific blocks from your library.
- Built-in wait steps that pause the tour until the user interacts with your application (for example, by clicking a button or navigating to a specific page).

### Custom steps

Custom steps are blocks from your block library that you can add into a tour. When creating a [block template](/block-templates), you can mark it as a tour block, making it available for tours.

### Tour step exit nodes

Tour-specific blocks come with predefined exit nodes to ensure reliable navigation through the tour:

- **`continue`**: Connects to the next step in the tour.
- **`previous`**: Connects to the previous step in the tour.
- **`cancel`**: Connects to the `cancel` exit node of the tour block.

To ensure compatibility, use these exit node keys in the underlying component.

## Wait property

Every tour step includes a **wait property** that pauses the tour until the user interacts with your application. This interaction can be a click event, navigation to a specific page, or no interaction at all. See the [wait property](/block-properties/wait) page for configuration details.

## Wait step

The **wait step** works similarly to the **wait property** but is implemented as a separate step within tour blocks. It pauses the tour until the user takes a specified action.

**Options:**

- **Interaction**: Defines the type of interaction required to proceed. Options include:
  - **Click**: Proceeds when the user clicks a specified element.
  - **Navigation**: Proceeds when the user navigates to a specific page.
  - **None**: Disables the wait property, requiring manual progression (e.g., via a button click).
- **Element**: The CSS selector of the element needed to be clicked to proceed (available when **Click** is selected).
- **Page**: Defines the target page or page for the interaction (available for both **Click** and **Navigation**). See the [page targeting](/block-properties/page-targeting) section for configuration details.
