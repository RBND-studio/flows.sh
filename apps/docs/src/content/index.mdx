## Overview

### Workflows

[Workflows](/workflows/overview) are the foundation of Flows, enabling you to create product tours, in-app announcements, guides, and more. They come with built-in state management, versioning, and analytics, removing the complexity of driving product adoption.

### Blocks

[Blocks](/blocks-overview) define the behavior of a workflow. They can represent UI elements, logical steps, or actions. Each block has customizable properties that define its behavior and can be connected to other blocks to form a workflow.

The connections between blocks (paths) determine how users navigate through the process.
