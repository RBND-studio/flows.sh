Flows makes it easy to add product adoption experiences into your React app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Integrating Flows into your app enables you to create interactive workflows, user onboarding, guided tours, in-app messaging, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating Flows into your Next.js app using the [React SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/react) and [components package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/react-components) to get you started.

  Check out our [template projects](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples) for
  examples of how to implement Flows in your application.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Install the React SDK and components package

You can install the Flows React SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/react):

```package-install
npm i @flows/react @flows/react-components
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Integrate FlowsProvider in your application

Create a Flows client component that wraps your application with the `FlowsProvider`. Then add
the `Flows` component to your root layout.

```tsx tab="app/flows.tsx"
"use client";

import Link from "next/link";

import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";
import * as components from "@flows/react-components";
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/react-components/tour";

import "@flows/react-components/index.css";

export default function Flows({ children }) {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID" // Find this in Settings > General
      userId="YOUR_USER_ID" // Replace this with user id from your app
      environment="production" // Default environment
      components={{ ...components }}
      tourComponents={{ ...tourComponents }}
      LinkComponent={Link}
    >
      {children}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
}
```

```tsx tab="app/layout.tsx"
import { Flows } from "./flows";

// Wrap your application with the Flows component from flows.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Flows>{children}</Flows>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

For a full list of supported properties, see the [FlowsProvider documentation](/sdk/react/reference#flowsprovider). For an example of how to create a custom component, see the [Next.js template project](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples/react/next).
