Flows makes it easy to add product adoption experiences into your [Solid](https://solidjs.com) app built with or without [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com). Integrating Flows into your app enables you to create interactive workflows, user onboarding, guided tours, in-app messaging, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating Flows into your Solid app using the [JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js) and [components package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js-components) to get you started.

  examples of how to implement Flows in your application.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Install the JavaScript SDK and components package

You can install the Flows JavaScript SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js):

```package-install
npm i @flows/js @flows/js-components
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Initialize the SDK

Use the `init` function to initialize the SDK with your organization ID and environment key, which you can find in the **Settings > General** and **Settings > Environments** sections of the Flows dashboard.

Create a `Flows` component to handle the initialization logic and rendering of the floating blocks. Then add the `Flows` component to your root layout. Lastly tell TypeScript about Flows custom elements in a `global.d.ts` file.

```tsx tab="flows.tsx"
import { onMount } from "solid-js";

import { init } from "@flows/js";
import { setupJsComponents } from "@flows/js-components";
import * as components from "@flows/js-components/components";
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/js-components/tour-components";

// Don't forget to import the CSS styles for Flows components
import "@flows/js-components/index.css";

export const Flows = () => {
  onMount(() => {
    init({
      organizationId: "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID", // Find this in Settings > General
      userId: "YOUR_USER_ID", // Identify the user
      environment: "production", // Default environment
    });
    setupJsComponents({
      components: { ...components },
      tourComponents: { ...tourComponents },
    });
  });

  return <flows-floating-blocks />;
};
```

```tsx tab="app.tsx"
import { Flows } from "./flows";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router
      root={(props) => (
        <MetaProvider>
          {props.children}
          {/* Add Flows component to the bottom of your layout */}
          <Flows />
        </MetaProvider>
      )}
    >
      {/* Your routes here */}
    </Router>
  );
}
```

```ts tab="global.d.ts"
import "solid-js";

// Tell TypeScript about Flows custom elements
declare module "solid-js" {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      "flows-floating-blocks": JSX.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>;
      "flows-slot": { "data-slot-id": string } & JSX.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>;
    }
  }
}
```

For a full list of supported properties, see the [init function documentation](/sdk/javascript/reference#init). For an example of how to create a custom component, see the [Solid template project](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples/solid).
