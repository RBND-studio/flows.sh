## Overview

Tours are guided, step-by-step instructions designed to help users complete a specific task or understand a feature within your application. They are often used for onboarding [users](/users/overview) or introducing new features. Tours must be integrated into a [workflow](/workflows/overview).

## Create a tour

Tours can be created only as a part of a workflow. To create a tour, follow these steps:

1. Add a tour block to an existing workflow using the **Add block** menu.
2. Configure each step to define the sequence and content of the tour.
3. Save and publish your workflow to make the tour available to users.

## Tours vs. workflows

Although both tours and workflows use blocks, their purposes differ:

- **Tours**: Linear, step-by-step instructions designed to help users complete a specific task or understand a feature.
- **Workflows**: Versatile processes supporting complex sequences with logic, actions, and conditions.

When choosing between a tour and a workflow, consider:

- If the sequence is short and needs to be completed in one session, use a **tour**.
- For longer or multi-session sequences, use a **workflow**.

### Benefits of tours

Tours are designed to provide a better user experience for step-by-step instructions. They main benefits include:

- **Low latency**: When a tour is started, the whole sequence is loaded into the user's browser, making switching between steps instant.
- **Forwards and backwards navigation**: Users can navigate to the previous steps, making it easier to review instructions.
- **State persistence**: Tours remember the user's progress, even if they leave and return later.

## Tour steps

Tours consist of tour-specific blocks from your block library. Each step behaves like a standard block but includes built-in connections to the previous and next steps through `previous` and `continue` exit nodes. A `cancel` exit node allows users to exit the tour at any step. See the [tour block](/tour-block) documentation for more details.
