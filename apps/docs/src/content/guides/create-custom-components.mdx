Custom components can be created in Flows. Components definitions store the properties and exit nodes for your custom component so Flows knows how your components work. Each component requires a corresponding UI component in your application.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Create a UI component

First, create or reuse a component within your application. This component will be rendered when users enter the block in a workflow.

In this guide, weâ€™ll build a marketing banner with the following customizable properties:

- Title
- Description
- Button label and link
- Option to hide a close button

If you would like to add different properties to your component, you can use the following types:

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- select (dropdown) - `"foo" | "bar" | "baz"`

```tsx title="banner.tsx"
import { ComponentProps } from "@flows/react";

type Props = ComponentProps<{
  title: string;
  description: string;
  buttonLabel: string;
  buttonLink: string;
  hideCloseButton?: boolean;
}>;

export const MyBanner = (props: Props): ReactNode => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>{props.title}</h2>
        {!props.hideCloseButton && <button>X</button>}
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>{props.description}</p>
        <a href={props.buttonLink}>{props.buttonLabel}</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Add exit node props

Now we will add exit node props that will allow Flows to react to user interactions with the block. Let's add `complete` and `close` props that will be called when the user clicks the button or the close button.

```tsx title="banner.tsx"
import { ComponentProps } from "@flows/react";

type Props = ComponentProps<{
  title: string;
  description: string;
  buttonLabel: string;
  buttonLink: string;
  hideCloseButton?: boolean;
  complete: () => void; // [!code highlight]
  close: () => void; // [!code highlight]
}>;
```

In case of a tour component, you should use `TourComponentProps` from `@flows/react` package. This will give you access to `previous`, `continue` and `cancel` props that are used to navigate through the tour.

```tsx title="tour-banner.tsx"
import { TourComponentProps } from "@flows/react"; // [!code highlight]

// [!code word:TourComponentProps]
type Props = TourComponentProps<{
  title: string;
  description: string;
  buttonLabel: string;
  buttonLink: string;
  hideCloseButton?: boolean;
}>;
```

And then use these props in the component:

```tsx title="banner.tsx"
export const MyBanner = (props: Props): ReactNode => (
  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>{props.title}</h2>
      // [!code word:props.close]
      {!props.hideCloseButton && <button onClick={props.close}>X</button>}
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>{props.description}</p>
      // [!code word:props.complete]
      <a onClick={props.complete} href={props.buttonLink}>
        {props.buttonLabel}
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Add component into the Flows provider

To make the component available to Flows, you need to add it to the `FlowsProvider` in your application.

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";
import { MyBanner } from "./banner";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id"
      environment="your-environment"
      // Add tour specific components here
      tourComponents={{}}
      components={{
        Banner: MyBanner, // [!code highlight]
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Create a component in Flows

Now that we have our UI component, we can create a component in Flows. Navigate to **Components** and click **New component**.

A dialog will appear where you need to enter a name for the component and select if the component is going to be used in a workflow or a tour.

</Step>

<Step>

## Specify component

To tell the Flows SDK which component to use, you need to enter the key you used in the `components` object passed to FlowsProvider. In our case, it's `Banner`.

</Step>

<Step>

## Select if the component is slottable

If your component is intended to be rendered inside the application, you need to select the **Slottable** option. This will allow you to specify a slot id when adding the block to a workflow. In our case, the banner component is /[slottable](/block-properties/slot) because we want to embed it into our application UI.

</Step>

<Step>

## Define block properties

Block properties are the fields that your editors can customize when they add the block to a workflow. They are the same as the props you defined in your component. For our banner component, we'll add the following properties:

| Name              | Key             | Type    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Title             | title           | string  |
| Description       | description     | string  |
| Button label      | buttonLabel     | string  |
| Button link       | buttonLink      | string  |
| Hide close button | hideCloseButton | boolean |

Each property has:

- **Title** - the name of the property
- **Description** - a short description of the property for the editor (e.g. instructions)
- **Key** - the key that will be used to pass the value to the component
- **Type** - the type of the property

</Step>

<Step>

## Add exit nodes

Exit nodes are the transitions that can be triggered when the user interacts with the block. For our banner component, we'll add two exit nodes:

- **`complete`** - when the user clicks the button
- **`close`** - when the user clicks the close button

The exit node has only a `key` field that needs to match the prop name in your component.

</Step>

<Step>

## Optional: More customization

You can also change the icon of your component by clicking on the icon above the component name.

</Step>

<Step>

## Save and publish

Once you've defined your properties and exit nodes, click **Publish changes** to make the latest version of the component available to use in your workflows.

![Component publish](/blocks/template-publish.png)

</Step>

<Step>

## Add block to workflow

Now that we have our component, we can add it to a workflow. Navigate to a workflow and click **Add block**. Select the component you created and configure the properties.

![Component add to workflow](/blocks/template-add-to-workflow.png)

</Step>

<Step>

## Finish the workflow

Once you've added the block to the workflow, you can connect it to other blocks and paths to create a complete workflow. Users will see your custom component when they reach the block in the workflow.
