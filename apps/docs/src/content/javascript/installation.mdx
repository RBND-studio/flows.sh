import { Step, Steps } from "fumadocs-ui/components/steps";

The [Flows JS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js) is a lightweight library that allows you to integrate Flows into any application that runs JavaScript. Similar to our React SDK, this SDK includes a components package to simplify getting started with Flows in your application.

<Callout>
  Check out our [template projects](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples) for
  examples of how to implement Flows in your application.
</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>

## Install the JavaScript SDK

You can install the Flows JavaScript SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js):

```package-install
npm i @flows/js
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Initialize the SDK

Use the `init` function to initialize the SDK with your organization ID and environment key, which you can find in the **Settings > General** and **Settings > Environments** sections of the Flows dashboard.

```js title="main.js"
import { init } from "@flows/js";

init({
  organizationId: "your-organization-id", // Found in Settings > General
  environment: "production", // Default environment
  userId: "your-user-id", // Identify the user
});
```

For a full list of supported properties, see the [init function documentation](/javascript/reference#init).

## Add a listener for floating blocks

Hereâ€™s a high-level example of rendering floating blocks using a pseudo UI library. Since `@flows/js` is designed to work with any JavaScript UI library/framework the example is in a generic code that illustrates how to use it with concepts that are common in most UI frameworks.

```js title="main.js"
import { addFloatingBlocksChangeListener } from "@flows/js";

// Pseudo UI library reactive state for managing blocks
const blocksState = uiState();

const dispose = addFloatingBlocksChangeListener((blocks) => {
  blocksState.set(blocks);
});

// Call `dispose` when you want to stop listening to the changes and avoid memory leaks
dispose();

// Define your components and tour components
const components = { ... }
const tourComponents = { ... }

// Pseudo UI library code that renders the blocks
const render = () => {
  return blocksState.map(block => {
    if(block.type === "component") {
      const Component = components[block.component]
      return <Component {...block.props} />
    }

    if(block.type === "tour-component") {
      const TourComponent = tourComponents[block.component]
      return <TourComponent {...block.props} />
    }
  })
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Add a listener for slot blocks

Rendering slot-specific blocks can be done by creating a reusable `FlowsSlot` component. This component listens for changes to slot blocks in a specific slot ID and renders the blocks accordingly.

```js title="flows-slot.js"
import { addSlotBlocksChangeListener } from "@flows/js";
// Import your components that we defined earlier
import { components, tourComponents } from "@/my-flows-components";

// Pseudo UI library reactive state
const mySlotBlocksState = uiState();

const dispose = addSlotBlocksChangeListener(
  // Pass a `slotId` prop to the component
  props.slotId,
  (blocks) => {
    blocksState.set(blocks);
  },
);
// Call `dispose` when you want to stop listening to the changes and avoid memory leaks
dispose();

// Pseudo UI library code that renders slot
const FlowsSlotRender = () => {
  // Without any blocks, render optional placeholder
  if (mySlotBlocksState.length === 0) return props.placeholder ?? null;

  return mySlotBlocksState.map((block) => {
    if (block.type === "component") {
      const Component = components[block.component];
      return <Component {...block.props} />;
    }

    if (block.type === "tour-component") {
      const TourComponent = tourComponents[block.component];
      return <TourComponent {...block.props} />;
    }
  });
};
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Optional: Use built-in components

To simplify implementation, you can use one of our pixel-perfect component libraries. The [Basics V1](/component-libraries/basics-v1/overview) library provides essential UI components like modals, tooltips, and hints that are fully compatible with Flows.
