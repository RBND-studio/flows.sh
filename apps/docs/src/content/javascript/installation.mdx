The [Flows JS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js) is a lightweight library that allows you to integrate Flows into any application that runs JavaScript. Similar to our React SDK, this SDK includes a components package to simplify getting started with Flows in your application.

  Check out our [template projects](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples) for
  examples of how to implement Flows in your application.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Install the JavaScript SDK

You can install the Flows JavaScript SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js):

```package-install
npm i @flows/js @flows/js-components
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Initialize the SDK

Use the `init` function to initialize the SDK with your organization ID and environment key, which you can find in the **Settings > General** and **Settings > Environments** sections of the Flows dashboard.

```js title="main.js"
import { init } from "@flows/js";

// Import the Basics V2 components and styles
import { setupJsComponents } from "@flows/js-components";
import * as components from "@flows/js-components/components";
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/js-components/tour-components";

// Import Basics V2 styles or copy them to your project and <link> them in your HTML
import "@flows/js-components/index.css";

init({
  organizationId: "your-organization-id", // Found in Settings > General
  environment: "production", // Default environment
  userId: "your-user-id", // Identify the user
});

// Defines custom elements for `flows-floating-blocks`, `flows-slot` and all the passed UI components.
setupJsComponents({
  components: { ...components },
  tourComponents: { ...tourComponents },
});
```

Add `<flows-floating-blocks>` custom element at the end of the `<body>` tag.

```html title="index.html"
<body>
  <!-- Your app content -->
  <flows-floating-blocks></flows-floating-blocks>
</body>
```

For a full list of supported properties, see the [init function documentation](/javascript/reference#init).
