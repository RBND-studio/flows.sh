## Overview

Environments allow you to manage [workflows](/workflows/overview) across the entire development lifecycle, from local development to production. Each environment operates independently with its own:

- Active workflow versions and statuses
- Workflow analytics
- Users

You can create an unlimited number of environments.

## Create an Environment

To create a new environment:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Environment**.
2. Enter a **unique key** for the environment. This key is used to identify the environment in the SDK.

## Edit an Environment

To modify an existing environment:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Environment**.
2. Update the **environment key** as needed.

**Important:** If you update the environment key, ensure the key is updated in your SDK setup to
prevent service disruptions.

## Using Environments

Each environment is associated with a unique key that links your application to the correct workflows. Include this key in your SDK setup:

```tsx title="layout.tsx" tab="React"
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id"
      environment="your-environment" // [!code highlight]
      userId="your-user-id"
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

```js title="main.js" tab="JavaScript"
import { init } from "@flows/js";

init({
  organizationId: "your-organization-id",
  environment: "your-environment", // [!code highlight]
  userId: "your-user-id",
});
```
