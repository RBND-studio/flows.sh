## Overview

**Basics V1** provides a set of ready-to-use components (**Modal**, **Tooltip**, and **Hint**) for building onboarding and education flows in your product. Each component integrates seamlessly with Flows, handling rendering, state, and lifecycle so you can focus on your app’s logic and UI.

## Installation

You can install and integrate the Basics V1 library using either **React** or **JavaScript**, depending on your application stack.

### React

<Steps>

<Step>

#### Install the React package

```package-install
@flows/react-components
```

</Step>

<Step>

#### Import and use components

Import the Basics V1 components and register them in the `FlowsProvider`.

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";
import * as components from "@flows/react-components"; // [!code highlight]
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/react-components/tour"; // [!code highlight]
import "@flows/react-components/index.css"; // [!code highlight]

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find this in Settings > General
      environment="production" // Default environment
      userId="your-user-id" // Identify the user
      tourComponents={{
        ...tourComponents, // [!code highlight]
      }}
      components={{
        ...components, // [!code highlight]
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

</Step>

<Step>

#### Enable library in Flows

In the Flows dashboard, go to **Components** and click the **Libraries** button. In the dialog that appears, find the Basics V1 library and click **Enable library**.

Once enabled, you’ll see the Basics V1 components available when adding new blocks to a workflow.

</Step>

</Steps>

### JavaScript

<Steps>

<Step>

#### Install the JavaScript package

```package-install
@flows/js-components
```

</Step>

<Step>

#### Setup components and rendering

For Flows to be able to render the components from the Basics V1 library, you need to setup the slot components and render function for the floating blocks. Rendering of slot blocks will be handled by the [flows-slot](/javascript/reference#flows-slot) element.

```js title="main.js"
import { init, addFloatingBlocksChangeListener } from "@flows/js";
import { render, updateSlotComponents } from "@flows/js-components";
import * as components from "@flows/js-components/components";
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/js-components/tour-components";

// Import the styles or copy them to your project and <link> them in your HTML
import "@flows/js-components/index.css";

init({ ... })

updateSlotComponents({ components, tourComponents })

const dispose = addFloatingBlocksChangeListener((blocks) => {
  render({ blocks, components,tourComponents });
});

// Call `dispose` when you want to stop listening to the changes to avoid memory leaks
dispose()
```

</Step>

<Step>

#### Enable the library in Flows

In the Flows dashboard, go to **Components** and click the **Libraries** button. In the dialog that appears, find the Basics V1 library and click **Enable library**.
