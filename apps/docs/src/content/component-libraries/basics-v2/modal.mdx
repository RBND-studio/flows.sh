## Overview

The modal component is great for focusing user attention on important information in a dialog separate from the rest of the page. It is typically used for welcoming users to your product or announcing new features. You can use the modal component out of the box as a built-in component.

## Installation

To integrate the modal component into your application, follow the steps described in the [library installation guide](/component-libraries/basics-v2/overview#installation).
