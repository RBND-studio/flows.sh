<ComponentPreview component="hint" />

## Overview

The hint component provides users with a subtle, contextual guidance without interrupting their flow. This component minimizes disruption while still drawing attention to important features or actions. You can use the hint component out of the box as a built-in component.

## Installation

To integrate the hint component into your application, follow the steps described in the [library installation guide](/component-libraries/basics-v2/overview#installation).
