<ComponentPreview component="tooltip" />

## Overview

The tooltip component is great to call attention to UI elements and guide users through a process. It is typically used as a part of a tour or to provide additional information about a specific element. You can use the tooltip component out of the box as a built-in component.

## Installation

To integrate the tooltip component into your application, follow the steps described in the [library installation guide](/component-libraries/basics-v2/overview#installation).
