## Examples

Check out our [example projects](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples) on GitHub for
examples of how to implement Flows in your application.

- [React Next.js example](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/blob/main/examples/react/next)
- [React Vite example](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/blob/main/examples/react/vite)
- [Vue Nuxt example](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/blob/main/examples/vue/nuxt)
- [Angular example](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/blob/main/examples/angular)

## Other frameworks

Angular, Svelte, Vue, and more SDKs are not on our roadmap yet. However, you can use the [Javascript SDK](/javascript/overview) to integrate Flows with any JavaScript framework. If you need help with a specific framework, check out our [example projects](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples) or [contact us](https://flows.sh/contact).

## Debug mode

All Flows SDKs support debug mode, which helps you inspect the SDK's behavior directly in your application. It’s designed for developers and product teams to troubleshoot, test, and verify workflow integrations.

When debug mode is enabled, a panel appears in your app showing real-time information about the SDK setup, user context, loaded workflows (blocks), and page state.

### What you can see in debug mode

The debug panel provides the following information:

- **User info**: The current `userId` and `userProperties` sent to Flows.
- **SDK setup**: The `organizationId` and `environment` used to initialize the SDK, along with validation status (e.g. whether the API responded successfully).
- **Blocks**: A summary of loaded and active blocks. You can log the full blocks object to the console for detailed inspection.
- **Pathname**: The current page pathname, helpful for debugging page-based targeting.

### How to enable debug mode

You can enable debug mode in three ways:

1. **SDK prop**: Refer to the SDK documentation for your framework to see how to enable debug mode via a prop or configuration option.
2. **Automatic in development**: Debug mode is automatically enabled when running on `localhost`. You can disable it by setting the `debug` prop to `false`.
3. **Keyboard shortcut**: Press `Cmd + Option + Shift + F` on Mac or `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + F` on Windows/Linux to toggle debug mode on and off anytime in your app. This is useful for inspecting the production environment without changing code. Can be customized by passing a function to the `onDebugShortcut` prop.

### Note on safety

The debug mode can be accessed by anyone using your application but it does not expose any sensitive information. If needed you can disable the debug panel in production by setting the `onDebugShortcut` prop to `() => false`, changing the keyboard shortcut, or by adding extra checks in your app to restrict access to the debug panel.
