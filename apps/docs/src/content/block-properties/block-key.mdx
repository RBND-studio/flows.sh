<Callout>Block key is only available on component blocks.</Callout>

## Overview

A block key is a unique identifier for a block, allowing you to identify blocks in SDK method responses.

## Usage in a workflow

You can set the block key in the settings of any component block within a workflow. This field is optional and is left empty by default.

## Usage in a block template

The block key is automatically included in every block template, so no manual configuration is needed. You can access it in your application through the following methods:

- **React SDK**
  - [useCurrentFloatingBlocks()](/react/reference#usecurrentfloatingblocks)
  - [useCurrentSlotBlocks()](/react/reference#usecurrentslotblocks)
  - Accessible in any block component via the `__flows.key` prop.
- **JavaScript SDK**
  - [getCurrentFloatingBlocks()](/javascript/reference#getcurrentfloatingblocks)
  - [getCurrentSlotBlocks()](/javascript/reference#getcurrentslotblocks)
  - [addFloatingBlocksChangeListener()](/javascript/reference#addfloatingblockschangelistener)
  - [addSlotBlocksChangeListener()](/javascript/reference#addslotblockschangelistener)
  - Accessible in any block component via the `__flows.key` prop.

## Example implementation

In this example we will use the block key to open and close a panel when specific block is active.

### Create a workflow and publish it

Set up a workflow with a [tour block](/tour-block) that includes the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Tooltip with a block key `close-menu` targeting a button with the `id=menu-button`.
- **Step 2**: Tooltip with a block key `inside-menu` pointing to a panel with the `id=menu-content`.

Configure other tooltip properties as needed.

</Step>

### Implement useCurrentFloatingBlocks() to control the menu

To open and close the menu, we will use the `useCurrentFloatingBlocks()` hook to track the active floating blocks for the user. We will look for the steps with the block keys `close-menu` and `inside-menu` to open and close the menu. When the steps are active we will set the state to open or close the menu.

```tsx title="menu.tsx"
import { useCurrentFloatingBlocks } from "@flows/react";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  // State to manage the menu visibility
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  // Get the floating blocks for the current user
  const blocks = useCurrentFloatingBlocks();

  // Look for the steps that open and close the menu. They are identified by the block key
  const openMenuStep = blocks.find((block) => block.props.__flows.key === "inside-menu");
  const closeMenuStep = blocks.find((block) => block.props.__flows.key === "close-menu");

  // When the steps are found, set the state to open or close the menu
  useEffect(() => {
    if (openMenuStep) {
      setOpen(true);
    }
    if (closeMenuStep) {
      setOpen(false);
    }
  }, [openMenuStep, closeMenuStep]);

  return (
    <div className="mx-auto max-w-3xl px-6 py-16" id="hidden-card">
      {/* Button to open the menu */}
      <Button variant="outline" id="menu-button" size="icon" onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>
        <Menu />
      </Button>

      {/* Menu content */}
      {open && (
        <div className="mt-2 rounded-sm border p-20" id="menu-content">
          <p className="text-center font-semibold text-muted-foreground" id="menu-text">
            Menu content here
          </p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Result

When users navigate through the tour:

- The menu opens when reaching the second step (`inside-menu` key).
- The menu closes upon returning to the first step (`close-menu` key).
- The menu remains open through additional steps unless explicitly closed.

To close the menu from another point, add a step with the block key `close-menu`.

This approach can be used outside of a tour block as well. For example, you can use the block key to open a popup when a specific block is active.
