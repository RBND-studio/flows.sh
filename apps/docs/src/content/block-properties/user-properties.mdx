## Overview

User properties fields allows you to target users based on their attributes. You can add multiple user properties to target users based on their attributes, in that case the properties are combined with an AND operator. User properties are only available in built-in logic blocks.

## Options

- **Property name**: The user attribute to target.
- **Data type**: The data type of the user attribute. See [supported types](/users/properties#property-types).
- **Operator**: The operator to use when comparing the user attribute value.
- **Values**: The value(s) to compare against the user attribute. You can add multiple values to match against (in that case the values are combined with an OR operator).
