## Overview

The action property allows you to create a button (or any other clickable element) that performs an action when clicked. This can be used to trigger another block in the workflow, go to another step in a tour, or open a link.

## Usage in a workflow

In a workflow, you can configure the action property to perform the desired action. To configure the action, click on the field and fill out the properties.

### In a workflow block

- **Label**: The label of the element used to trigger the action (eg. button text).
- **Action type** (optional): Select the type of action you want to perform. The available options are:
  - **Go to exit node**: Trigger one of the blockâ€™s exit nodes.
  - _Looking for more options? [Contact us](https://flows.sh/contact) and let us know what you need._
- **Link** (optional): By clicking on the **Add link** button, you can add a link to the action. This link will be opened when the action is triggered. You can also select whether to open the link in a new tab or not.

### In a tour block

- **Label**: The label of the element used to trigger the action (eg. button text).
- **Action type** (optional): Select the type of action you want to perform. The available options are:
  - **Go to next step**: Trigger the next step in the tour.
  - **Go to previous step**: Trigger the previous step in the tour.
  - **Cancel tour**: Exit the tour using the `cancel` exit node.
- **Link** (optional): By clicking on the **Add link** button, you can add a link to the action. This link will be opened when the action is triggered. You can also select whether to open the link in a new tab or not.

## Usage in a component

In a component, you can define the action property like any other property. The properties to fill out are:

- **Title**: The title of the action shown in the block editor.
- **Description**: The description of the action shown in the block editor (optional).
- **Type**: Select action from the dropdown.
- **Key**: The key of the property that will contain the action data in your component.

Below is an example implementation of action:

```tsx title="Action component example"
import { type Action, type ComponentProps } from "@flows/react";

type Props = ComponentProps<{
  actionProperty?: Action;
}>;

export const ActionComponent = ({ actionProperty }: Props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* When no actionProperty is passed we don't render the button */}
      {actionProperty ? <ActionButton actionProperty={actionProperty} /> : null}
    </div>
  );
};

// Helper component to handle the action
const ActionButton = ({ actionProperty }: { actionProperty: Action }) => {
  // If the action has a URL, render as a link; otherwise, render as a button
  // You can replace these components with your own
  const Component = actionProperty.url ? "a" : "button";

  return (
    <Component
      href={actionProperty.url}
      target={actionProperty.openInNew ? "_blank" : undefined}
      onClick={actionProperty.callAction}
    >
      {actionProperty.label}
    </Component>
  );
};
```
