![State memory properties](/block-properties/state-memory.png)

## Overview

The State memory property is used to store a boolean value in the block's state. This is ideal for tracking user progress such as whether a user has completed a task in a checklist.

<Callout type="info">
  State memory is only available for workflow blocks, not for tour blocks.
</Callout>

## Usage in a workflow

In a workflow, you can configure the state memory to track whether a user has exited a specific block. To configure the state memory, select the trigger type:

- **Manual**: The state memory can be set from your application using the SDK. For example by clicking a button and calling `setValue`.
- **Block exit**: The state memory will be set to `true` when the user exits the selected block.

## Usage in a block template

In a block template, you can define the state memory like any other property. The properties to fill out are:

- **Title**: The title of the state memory shown in the block editor.
- **Description**: The description of the state memory shown in the block editor (optional).
- **Type**: Select state memory from the dropdown.
- **Key**: The key of the boolean value stored in the block's state. This key is used to access the value in your application.

## Example implementation

In this example, we'll create a simple checklist where each task is marked as completed when the user exits the specified block.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create a block template

Create a block template with an [array](/block-properties/array) named tasks. Each item in the array includes a title and a completed property that is a State memory.

</Step>

<Step>

### Create a UI component

Next, build a matching component in your application to render the checklist:

```tsx
import { ComponentProps, StateMemory } from "@flows/react";

type Props = ComponentProps<{
  items: {
    title: string;
    completed: StateMemory;
  }[];
}>;

export const Checklist = ({ items }: Props) => {
  return (
    <div className="mb-5 rounded-md border p-4">
      <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Onboarding checklist</p>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <div className="mt-3 flex items-center gap-1" key={index}>
          {item.completed.value ? (
            <CheckCircle className="text-green-600" />
          ) : (
            <Circle className="text-gray-300" />
          )}
          {!item.completed.value && (
            <button onClick={() => item.completed.setValue(true)}>Complete</button>
          )}
          <p className="text-sm">{item.title}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Here, Tailwind CSS classes style the list and Lucide provide icons. You can customize the component to match your applicationâ€™s design system as needed.

</Step>

<Step>

### Use the component in a workflow

Now we can use the **Checklist** component in a workflow. When the user enters the block, the Checklist component will render the list of tasks. Then when the user completes either the tour or the card task, the corresponding task will be marked as completed in the checklist.

</Step>

<Step>

### Result

Now you have a block that renders a simple onboarding checklist and tracks the user progress. You can add as many tasks as you want and they will be rendered in the order you added them.
