<Callout>
  Slot properties are only available in slottable blocks. The slots need to be defined in your
  application before they can be used in Flows.
</Callout>

## Overview

When a block is slottable (i.e., designed to render within your application), additional slot-specific properties are available:

- **Slot ID**: Specifies the slot where the block will be rendered, as defined in your application.
- **Slot index**: Controls the rendering order when multiple blocks share the same slot. Blocks with lower index render first.

These properties allow you to insert components into your application using predefined slots. Note that the slots need to be defined in your application before they can be used in Flows. See the [SDK documentation](/sdk-overview) for more information.
