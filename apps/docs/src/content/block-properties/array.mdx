## Overview

The Array property is used to create multiple items with the same structure but different values. This is ideal for lists where every item follows a consistent format—such as checklists or collections of useful links.

## Usage in a workflow

In a workflow, adding items to an array is as simple as clicking the + button next to the array title. Each added item conforms to the defined structure, and the order in which you add them determines their display order.

## Usage in a component

In a component, you can define the array property like any other property. The properties to fill out are:

- **Title**: The title of the array shown in the block editor.
- **Description**: The description of the array shown in the block editor (optional).
- **Type**: Select array from the dropdown.
- **Key**: The key of the array of items. This key is used to access the array items in your application.
- **Items**: The individual items in the array. Each item can be any type except for another array.

## Example implementation

In this example, we’ll create a list where each link has a title and a URL.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create a component

Create a component with an array named links. Each item in the array includes a title and a url.

</Step>

<Step>

### Create a UI component

Next, build a matching component in your application to render the list of links:

```tsx
type Props = {
  links: {
    title: string;
    url: string;
  }[];
};

export const LinksList = ({ links }: Props): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <ul>
      <p className="font-semibold">Links:</p>
      {links.map((item) => (
        <li className="list-disc text-blue-500 underline" key={item.title}>
          <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

Here, Tailwind CSS classes style the list. You can customize the component to match your application’s design system as needed.

</Step>

<Step>

### Use the component in a workflow

Now we can use the **Links List** component in a workflow. When the user enters the block, the LinksList component will render the list of links.

</Step>

<Step>

### Result

Now you have a block that renders a list of usefull links. You can add as many links as you want and they will be rendered in the order you added them.
