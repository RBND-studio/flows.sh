The [Flows React SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/react) is a library that allows you to integrate Flows into React applications. It includes a components package to simplify getting started with Flows in your application.

  Check out our [template projects](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples) for
  examples of how to implement Flows in your application.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Install the React SDK and components package

You can install the Flows React SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/react):

```package-install
npm i @flows/react @flows/react-components
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Add the FlowsProvider

The SDK provides a `FlowsProvider` component that you can use to wrap your app. Initialize it with your organization ID and environment key, which you can find in the **Settings > General** and **Settings > Environments** sections of the Flows dashboard.

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";
// Import the Basics V1 components and styles
import * as components from "@flows/react-components";
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/react-components/tour";
import "@flows/react-components/index.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find this in Settings > General
      environment="production" // Default environment
      userId="your-user-id" // Identify the user
      // Add the Basics V1 components
      tourComponents={{
        ...tourComponents,
      }}
      components={{
        ...components,
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

For a full list of supported properties, see the [FlowsProvider documentation](/react/reference#flowsprovider).
