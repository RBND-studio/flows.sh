## @flows/react

Flows React SDK is a library that allows you to integrate Flows into React applications.

Install the package [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/react):

```package-install
npm i @flows/react
```

### Components

#### FlowsProvider

The `<FlowsProvider />` component is the main component of the Flows SDK. It initializes the SDK and keeps track of the user's state.

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find this in Settings > General
      environment="production" // Default environment
      userId="your-user-id" // Identify the user
      components={{}}
      tourComponents={{}}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```

The `<FlowsProvider />` accepts the following props:

## @flows/react-components

To simplify implementation, you can use the `@flows/react-components` package, which provides pre-built UI components.

Install the package [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/react-components):

```package-install
npm i @flows/react-components
```

Then, import and use the components in your app:

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { FlowsProvider } from "@flows/react";
import * as components from "@flows/react-components"; // [!code highlight]
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/react-components/tour"; // [!code highlight]
import "@flows/react-components/index.css"; // [!code highlight]

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlowsProvider
      organizationId="your-organization-id" // Find this in Settings > General
      environment="production" // Default environment
      userId="your-user-id" // Identify the user
      tourComponents={{
        ...tourComponents, // [!code highlight]
      }}
      components={{
        ...components, // [!code highlight]
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </FlowsProvider>
  );
};
```
