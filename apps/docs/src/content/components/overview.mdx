Flows has a library of UI components to help get started quickly with building your onboarding. These components are flexible, customizable, and can easily be adapted to match your brand’s identity. Need something unique? You can also build custom components tailored to your requirements.

## Built-in components

<Cards>
  <Card title="Modal" icon={<Modal16 />} href="/components/modal">
    Display a modal to guide users through a process.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tooltip" icon={<Tooltip16 />} href="/components/tooltip">
    Guide users with helpful tooltips.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hint" icon={<Hint16 />} href="/components/hint">
    Provide subtle hints to users.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Custom components

If the built-in options don’t meet your needs, you can create custom components. Visit the [custom components](/components/custom) page to learn more and get started.
