## Overview

The tooltip component is great to call attention to UI elements and guide users through a process. It is typically used as a part of a tour or to provide additional information about a specific element. You can use the tooltip component out of the box as a built-in component.

## Installation

To integrate the tooltip component into your application, install the Flows components package. This package provides the tooltip along with other built-in components. For detailed instructions, see [React installation](/react/installation#optional-use-built-in-components) or [JavaScript installation](/javascript/installation#optional-use-built-in-components).
