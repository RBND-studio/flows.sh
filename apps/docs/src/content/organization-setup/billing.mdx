## How our plans and billing works

### Plans

Flows offers a **Forever Free** plan with generous usage limits, ideal for startups and small teams. When you're ready to scale, our **Pay-As-You-Go** plan ensures flexibility with costs based on actual usage. For the most up-to-date information, visit our [pricing page](https://flows.sh/pricing).

### Billing

Billing is calculated based on Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs) across all [environments](/environments) in your organization. You are billed monthly, and subscriptions can be canceled anytime.

**Pay-As-You-Go:** Costs are based on the total MTUs during the billing period. A monthly cycle begins on your subscription date and renews on the same day each month. For example, if you subscribe on the 15th, your next cycle will start on the 15th of the following month. The MTU (Monthly Tracked User) count resets 24 hours before the next billing cycle begins. This window ensures all usage data is properly processed and finalized for accurate invoicing.

**Free Plan:** Usage limits reset at the start of every month. If you reach the limit, you cannot identify new [users](/users/overview) until the next cycle, but existing users continue to access workflows without interruption.

### How do we calculate Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)?

MTUs are the number of unique users that have experienced a Flows workflow in the current billing cycle. Individual users are counted based on the `userId` you provide in the Flows SDK.

**User is counted if:**

- The Flows SDK has rendered a component in their browser
- The user has exited a component block using one of the blocks exit nodes (resetting a workflow or publishing a new version doesn't count) - this is a temporary solution for customers with SDKs older than 1.9.0

**User is not counted if:**

- They have entered a workflow, but no components have been rendered.
- They are active in a workflow but have not visited your product in the current billing cycle.
- They are not active in any workflow.
- They have not visited your product in the current billing cycle.

If a user is counted as MTU, they can experience any number of workflows in the current billing cycle.

## Manage your billing

To manage your subscription, navigate to **Settings > Billing**, where you can:

- Upgrade or downgrade your plan
- Update payment or billing contact information
- Review billing history, invoices, and payments

### Upgrade to a paid plan

Navigate to **Settings > Billing** and select **Upgrade**. Your new plan takes effect immediately, starting a new billing cycle from the day you upgrade.

### Cancel a Subscription

To cancel a subscription, navigate to **Settings > Billing**. Your subscription will be canceled immediately, and your usage limit will revert to the Free tier. The last invoice will be generated at the end of the billing cycle.

### Set a usage Limit

The **Pay-As-You-Go** plan includes the option to set usage limits to avoid surprises. Configure these limits in the **Usage Limit** section of **Settings > Billing**.

- Notifications are sent when you reach 80% and 100% of your limit.
- Once the limit is reached, new users will not be identified until the next billing cycle or the limit is increased. Users already counted in MTUs can continue to experience workflows without interruption.
