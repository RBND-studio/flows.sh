## Overview

You can manually invite and remove members from the organization settings page. Currently, everyone has the same permissions, but we will introduce roles in the future.

## Invite members

To send an invitation:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**.
2. Click **Invite Member**.
3. Enter the email address of the invitee.
4. Click **Send invite**.

The recipient will receive an email with an invitation link valid for 7 days. After joining, they’ll gain full access to the organization and its workflows.

## Remove members

To revoke a member's access:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**.
2. Click **Remove** next to the member’s name.

Please note that until we implement member roles, any member of the organization can remove others.

## Join an organization

The only way to join an organization is via invitation. When you receive an invitation to join an organization, click the link in the email to join the organization or log in to Flows and accept the invitation.

## Leave an organization

If you need to leave an organization:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Account > Organizations**.
2. Click **Leave Organization** next to the organization you want to leave.

You cannot leave if you’re the last member of the organization.
