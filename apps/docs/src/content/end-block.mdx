![End block](/blocks/end.png)

## Overview

When a user reaches an end block, they will exit the workflow. This happens even if there are other branches in the workflow that have not yet reached the end block.

Once the workflow is exited, the user will not be able to re-enter unless the workflow frequency is set to **Every time**.

## Automatic end

End blocks are optional. The workflow will automatically complete when all blocks are finished. In other words, when a user exits a block that isn't connected to any other blocks:

- If there are no other uncompleted blocks in the workflow, the **workflow will end**.
- If there are blocks that were not completed yet, the **workflow will not end**.

End blocks are useful when you want to ensure that a user exits the workflow at a specific point, regardless of the path they took to get there or the blocks they have completed.

## Multiple end blocks

Multiple end blocks can be used in a single workflow to allow different exit conditions. Regardless of which end block a user reaches, they will exit the whole workflow.

## Reset user progress

You can reset the user's progress manually in their [user profile](/users/overview). Once reset, the user will be able to re-enter the workflow if they meet the start block conditions.
