![End block](/blocks/end.png)

## Overview

When a user reaches an end block, they will exit the workflow. This happens even if there are other branches in the workflow that have not yet reached the end block.

Once the workflow is exited, the user will not be able to re-enter unless the workflow frequency is set to **Every time**.

## Multiple end blocks

Multiple end blocks can be used in a single workflow to allow different exit conditions. Regardless of which end block a user reaches, they will exit the whole workflow.

## Reset user progress

You can reset the user's progress manually in their [user profile](/users/overview). Once reset, the user will be able to re-enter the workflow if they meet the start block conditions.
