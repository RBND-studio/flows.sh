Flows makes it easy to add product adoption experiences into your [Angular](https://angular.dev/) app. Integrating Flows into your app enables you to create interactive workflows, user onboarding, guided tours, in-app messaging, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating Flows into your Angular app using the [JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js) and [components package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js-components) to get you started.

  Check out our [template projects](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples) for
  examples of how to implement Flows in your application.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Install the JavaScript SDK and components package

You can install the Flows JavaScript SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js):

```package-install
npm i @flows/js @flows/js-components
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Initialize the SDK

Use the `init` function to initialize the SDK with your organization ID and environment key, which you can find in the **Settings > General** and **Settings > Environments** sections of the Flows dashboard.

Create a `FlowsService` to handle the initialization logic, and call the service in your root component. We'll also need to tell Angular that we'll be using custom elements in our root component by adding `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to the component's `schemas` array. And finally, add the `<flows-floating-blocks>` custom element to your root component's template to render floating blocks.

```ts lineNumbers tab="flows.service.ts"
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

import { init } from "@flows/js";
import { setupJsComponents } from "@flows/js-components";
import * as components from "@flows/js-components/components";
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/js-components/tour-components";

import "@flows/js-components/index.css";

@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class FlowsService {
  init() {
    init({
      organizationId: "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID", // Find this in Settings > General
      userId: "YOUR_USER_ID", // Identify the user
      environment: "production", // Default environment
    });
    setupJsComponents({
      components: { ...components },
      tourComponents: { ...tourComponents },
    });
  }
}
```

```ts lineNumbers tab="app.ts"
import { Component, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA, inject } from "@angular/core";
import { FlowsService } from "./flows.service";

@Component({
  // Other options

  // Tell Angular we'll be using custom elements in this component
  // (<flows-floating-blocks> and <flows-slot>)
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
export class App {
  flowsService = inject(FlowsService);
  ngOnInit() {
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      this.flowsService.init();
    }
  }
}
```

```html lineNumbers tab="app.html"
<router-outlet />

<!-- Custom element for rendering floating blocks -->
<flows-floating-blocks></flows-floating-blocks>
```

For a full list of supported properties, see the [init function documentation](/javascript/reference#init). For an example of how to create a custom component, see the [Angular template project](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples/angular).
