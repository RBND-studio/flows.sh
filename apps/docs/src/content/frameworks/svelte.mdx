Flows makes it easy to add product adoption experiences into your [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev) app. Integrating Flows into your app enables you to create interactive workflows, user onboarding, guided tours, in-app messaging, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating Flows into your Svelte app using the [JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js) and [components package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js-components) to get you started.

  Check out our [template projects](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples) for
  examples of how to implement Flows in your application.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Install the JavaScript SDK and components package

You can install the Flows JavaScript SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js):

```package-install
npm i @flows/js @flows/js-components
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Initialize the SDK

Use the `init` function to initialize the SDK with your organization ID and environment key, which you can find in the **Settings > General** and **Settings > Environments** sections of the Flows dashboard.

Add the initialization logic to your root layout. Also, add the `<flows-floating-blocks>` custom element to your root layout to render floating blocks.

```svelte lineNumbers title="routes/+layout.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { onMount } from "svelte";

  import { init } from "@flows/js";
  import { setupJsComponents } from "@flows/js-components";
  import * as components from "@flows/js-components/components";
  import * as tourComponents from "@flows/js-components/tour-components";

  import "@flows/js-components/index.css";

  onMount(() => {
    init({
      organizationId: "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID", // Find this in Settings > General
      userId: "YOUR_USER_ID", // Identify the user
      environment: "production", // Default environment
    });
    setupJsComponents({
      components: { ...components },
      tourComponents: { ...tourComponents },
    });
  });
</script>

<div class="app">
  <!-- Your app code here -->

  <!-- Custom element for rendering floating blocks -->
  <flows-floating-blocks></flows-floating-blocks>
</div>
```

For a full list of supported properties, see the [init function documentation](/javascript/reference#init). For an example of how to create a custom component, see the [SvelteKit template project](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples/svelte).
