Flows makes it easy to add product adoption experiences into your Vue app built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com). Integrating Flows into your app enables you to create interactive workflows, user onboarding, guided tours, in-app messaging, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating Flows into your Vue app using the [JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js) and [components package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js-components) to get you started.

  Check out our [template projects](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples) for
  examples of how to implement Flows in your application.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Install the JavaScript SDK and components package

You can install the Flows JavaScript SDK [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flows/js):

```package-install
npm i @flows/js @flows/js-components
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Initialize the SDK

Use the `init` function to initialize the SDK with your organization ID and environment key, which you can find in the **Settings > General** and **Settings > Environments** sections of the Flows dashboard.

Create a Flows Nuxt plugin to handle the initialization logic. Add `<flows-floating-blocks>` custom element to your root component to render floating blocks. Finally, tell Vue about Flows custom elements to avoid rendering them as Vue components in `nuxt.config.ts`.

```ts lineNumbers tab="plugins/flows.ts"
import { defineNuxtPlugin } from "nuxt/app";

import { init } from "@flows/js";
import { setupJsComponents } from "@flows/js-components";
import * as components from "@flows/js-components/components";
import * as tourComponents from "@flows/js-components/tour-components";

import "@flows/js-components/index.css";

export default defineNuxtPlugin({
  name: "flows",
  parallel: true,
  hooks: {
    "app:mounted"() {
      init({
        organizationId: "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID", // Find this in Settings > General
        userId: "YOUR_USER_ID", // Identify the user
        environment: "production", // Default environment
      });
      setupJsComponents({
        components: { ...components },
        tourComponents: { ...tourComponents },
      });
    },
  },
});
```

```html lineNumbers tab="app.vue"
<template>
  <!-- Your app code here -->

  <!-- Custom element for rendering floating blocks -->
  <flows-floating-blocks></flows-floating-blocks>
</template>
```

```ts lineNumbers tab="nuxt.config.ts"
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Your options here

  vue: {
    compilerOptions: {
      // Tell Vue about Flows custom elements to avoid rendering it as Vue components
      isCustomElement: (tag) => ["flows-floating-blocks", "flows-slot"].includes(tag),
    },
  },
});
```

For a full list of supported properties, see the [init function documentation](/javascript/reference#init). For an example of how to create a custom component, see the [Vue Nuxt template project](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples/vue/nuxt).
