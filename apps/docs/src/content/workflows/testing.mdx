## Overview

Testing workflows is an essential step in ensuring your workflows run smoothly. Flows provides tools to validate and debug workflows before they are deployed.

## How to test a workflow

Follow these steps to test your workflow:

1. **Publish to test environment**: Publish the workflow in a test environment by clicking the **Publish** button in the workflow editor's top-right corner.
2. **Log in to your application**: Access your application in the test environment.
3. **Trigger the workflow**: Trigger the workflow by meeting the start block conditions. This may involve creating a new user, updating a user property, or performing another action that triggers the workflow.
4. **Verify behavior**: Confirm that the workflow executes as expected.

To simplify testing, set the workflow frequency to `Every time`. This allows you to test
repeatedly without needing additional changes.

### Using draft version

Flows allows you to apply the draft version of a workflow in an environment. This is useful for testing the workflow as you make changes without needing to publish a new version every time. To use the draft version in an environment:

- Click on **Environments** in the workflow editor.
- Using the **Workflow version** dropdown, apply the draft version to the desired environment.
- Save the changes.

Things to keep in mind when using the draft version:

- Never use the draft version in a production environment â€“ as you make edits to your workflow the draft version can get into a broken state (eg. missing blocks, broken connections).
- It is easy to get stuck in an invalid state when using the draft version. Make sure to [reset](#2-restart-a-single-user) the workflow state for your test user if you get stuck.

## Restart a workflow

If necessary, you can restart a workflow during testing. There are two methods to achieve this:

### 1. Publish a new version

When you publish a new version of a workflow, choose the **Restart all in-progress users** option. This resets the workflow for all [users](/users/overview) currently in progress.

### 2. Restart a single user

To restart for a specific user without publishing a new version:

- Navigate to the user's profile.
- Switch to the **Workflows** tab.
- Click the **Reset progress** button next to the relevant workflow. Learn more about [user workflow states](/users/workflow-states).

## Debug workflows

When debugging workflows there are multiple places to look for information:

- **Workflow editor**: Review the workflow in the editor to ensure the logic is correct.
- **User log**: View the user's [log](/users/log) to see the workflow execution steps.
- **User workflow state**: Check the user's [workflow state](/users/workflow-states) to see if they are in progress, completed, or haven't started the workflow.
- **Browser console**: Check the browser console for any errors that may have occurred during workflow execution.
- **Broser network tab**: Check the network tab in the browser console to see if the SDK requests are successful.
