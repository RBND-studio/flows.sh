## Overview

Blocks represent individual steps in a workflow, such as UI components, logic, or actions. Each block has configurable properties that determine its behavior. By connecting blocks through paths, you create a workflow.

## Add a block

To add a block to your workflow:

1. Click the **Add block** button located in the workflow toolbar at the bottom center of your screen.
2. Select a block from your block library.
3. Drag and drop the block to its intended position in the workflow editor.
4. Configure the block's properties in the settings panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

## Remove a block

To remove a block from your workflow:

1. Click the block you want to remove to select it.
2. Open the **`•••`** menu in the top right corner of the block's settings panel.
3. Select **Delete block** from the dropdown menu.

This action removes the block and disconnects all associated paths.

## Next steps

After adding blocks, you need to configure their properties and exit nodes. To learn more, see [Configure blocks](/workflows/configure-blocks).
