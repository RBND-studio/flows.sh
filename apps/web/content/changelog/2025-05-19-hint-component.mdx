Meet the newest addition to our built-in components: the **Hint component**. Hints are a great way to subtly call attention to specific elements on your page, they allow you to provide contextual information that users can engage with at their own pace.

To start using it in your workflows, choose either the `Default Hint` or `Default Tour Hint` component when adding blocks. For full details, head over to the [documentation](https://flows.sh/docs/components/hint).

## Redesigned website

We've given our website a fresh coat of paint! Check out the new design at [flows.sh](https://flows.sh) and let us know what you think. We hope you like it as much as we do.

## Other improvements

- Added a new workflow example: [Product Hunt launch](https://flows.sh/examples/product-hunt-launch-announcement)

## SDK improvements

- The Flows JS SDK can now be loaded via CDN — making it easier to integrate Flows without needing a build step. See the [template](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples/js/cdn) for more info.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the version picker could overflow when displaying too many versions.
- Improved the usage widget’s loading state to avoid showing 0 users while data is still loading.
