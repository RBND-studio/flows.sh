## Better tables

Workflow, User, and Block tables now display more detailed information. You can track workflow statuses, the number of active workflows for a user, and the last updated date for custom components among other things.

We've also improved the pagination in the Users table, now even with a lot of users, you can easily navigate through them.

## Tour wait delay

Setup a delay between tour steps to give users time to process content or wait for elements to load. Learn more in the [docs](/docs/tour-block#wait-property).

## SDK improvements

- Added [resetWorkflowProgress](/docs/react/reference#resetworkflowprogress) and [resetAllWorkflowsProgress](/docs/react/reference#resetallworkflowsprogress) functions to the JS and React SDKs.
- Added [useCurrentFloatingBlocks](/docs/react/reference#usecurrentfloatingblocks) and [useCurrentSlotBlocks](/docs/react/reference#usecurrentslotblocks) hooks in the React SDK. Use them to track active blocks and trigger actions in your product.
- Fixed an issue where the tooltip rendered even when the target element didn't exist on the page.

## Other improvements

- Paths with identical origins and destinations are now grouped in the workflow editor, preventing overlapping exit node labels.
- Added **equals** and **not equals** operators to page targeting.
- Tour steps can now be reordered with drag-and-drop.
- Added unique key validation for component properties and exit nodes.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the Environments dialog sometimes failed to load fully.
- The workflow **updated at** column now displays the correct date.
- Improved performance when publishing a new workflow with a lot of users.
