With block level analytics, you can now see detailed metrics for each block in your workflow (including tour steps). Use this data to identify drop-off points, optimize user journeys, and improve overall engagement.

## Workflow editor improvements

The editor now feels closer to a design tool, with improved zoom interactions and support for dragging multiple blocks at once. Built on React Flow, this update improves navigation and organization for complex workflows while laying the foundation for future enhancements.

## Other improvements

- Added “Copy as markdown” and “Open in LLMs” options on documentation pages for easier sharing and AI support.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where, in rare cases, the React SDK could miss block updates during initial load.
