When we released Flows 2.0, we introduced **Block templates** as a way to create custom UI components for workflows. The name turned out to be confusing, so we’ve simplified it to **Components**.

Along with the rename, we’re adding **Component libraries** – a new way to manage the built-in components that come with Flows. Libraries let us ship new components without cluttering your workspace or causing breaking changes.

If you don’t use our built-in components, you can hide the entire library to make it clear which components your team should use.

Learn more in our [docs](/docs/components/overview).

## Block connection UX improvements

Connecting blocks in the editor is now faster and more intuitive. When you hover over a block with no connections, a plus icon appears, allowing you to quickly add and connect a new block.

You can also create and connect a new block directly from the exit nodes menu when selecting from existing blocks.

## Other improvements

- Added **Block activated** data to analytics to help you better understand how blocks are being used in workflows.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where workflows with a tour block as the final block would not be marked as finished after the tour completed.
