description: Introducing two new block properties to help you create more interactive workflows. We've also made some SDK improvements and fixed a few bugs.

These new block properties finally enable building onboarding checklists and hubs.

## State memory property

Use a boolean value stored in the block’s state to keep track of user progress. This lets you mark whether someone has finished a certain task or seen a particular message. State memory is perfect for onboarding flows or checklists where you need to remember the user’s progress.

## Block trigger property

With the block trigger property, you can launch one block directly from another without exiting the current block. This is useful for starting a tour or opening a modal from an onboarding checklist or hub.

## SDK improvements

- Added a template for using the Flows JS SDK in Angular applications. Check out the [Angular template](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples/angular) in the Flows SDK repository.

## Bug fixes

- When adding a wait step to a tour, the add popup now closes right after the step is added
- Workflows no longer display to active users once the workflow live status is turned off
