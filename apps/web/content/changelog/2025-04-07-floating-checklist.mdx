Checklists are a great way to nudge users to take actions in your app. With our new Floating Checklist example you can add one into your product in minutes.
The UI is fully customizable to fit your brand and like all our examples it comes with full source code. See it in action [here](/examples/floating-checklist/).

## Flows 1.0 shutdown

As of March 31, 2025, Flows 1.0 has officially been shut down, marking the end of an important chapter. We are grateful to all our early users who helped shape the product. Flows 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the product and we are excited to continue building the future of product adoption with you.

## Improved design of built-in Tooltip and Modal

Our built-in Tooltip and Modal components have been refreshed with a more polished design. The new design includes transition animations that make the components feel more fluid and responsive. Update your SDKs to enjoy these improvements, but watch out for possible breaking changes in CSS.

## Other improvements

- Added an indicator to the user detail page to show if the user counts toward MTUs for the current billing period
- Added recent workflows widget to the Home page
- Improved performance of custom component form when editing larger components
- Optimized periodic usage notifications to reduce backend load and response times

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where default values were not properly set for all block properties when adding a new block to a workflow
