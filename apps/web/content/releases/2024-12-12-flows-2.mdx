We're thrilled to announce the launch of Flows 2.0! This release marks a significant step forward for us, and we can't wait to see what you'll create with it.

## What's new

We've completely rebuilt Flows, transforming it from a basic onboarding tool into a powerful platform for crafting fully custom in-app experiences. Here are the key features:

- **Workflow**: Create complex, multi-step experiences that span multiple sessions or even the entire user lifecycle.
- **Tour**: Step-by-step guides that lead users through processes.
- **Custom UI components**: Build and integrate your own UI components within Flows.
- **Slottable components**: Dynamically embed components into your application.

## How to migrate

Unfortunately, we couldn't automatically migrate your existing Flows to the new version. We've prepared a detailed guide on how to migrate to Flows 2.0, available in our documentation. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

**The old version of Flows will be shut down on February 28, 2025**. Please ensure you migrate your Flows before this date.
During this period, any usage of Flows 1.0 is free of charge for everyone.

PS: We've removed most of the old changelog entries, as they are not relevant after this release. You can still find them in the [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows.sh/tree/db8235a4acfda87961cad2bef1f68a437908fc38/apps/web/content/releases).
