To better reflect our mission and values, we've updated our branding. We wanted to reflect that Flows is a tool for builders to create anything they can imagine. We are excited to share this new look with you!

## SDK 0.1

We weren't only polishing the pixels. Our SDK is now mature enough to call it 0.1. We've worked out the main concepts and APIs, and we are ready to start building on top of it. We are excited to see what you will create with it!
