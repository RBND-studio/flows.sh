To make Flows 2.0 more accessible to a wider range of developers, we have introduced a JavaScript SDK. This new SDK offers functionality similar to the React SDK but is designed to be framework-agnostic, allowing it to integrate with any JavaScript application.

To see how it works, check out our [Nuxt template](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-sdk/tree/main/examples/vue/nuxt-custom-components), which demonstrates how the JavaScript SDK can replicate the functionality of the React SDK example. For additional details, refer to the [JavaScript SDK documentation](https://flows.sh/docs/sdk/javascript/reference).

## Workflow Examples

Saying "you can build anything with Flows" is one thing, but showing it is another. That’s why we’ve released an [examples library](https://flows.sh/examples) showcasing various workflows built with Flows.

The examples are open-source and can be used as a starting point for your own workflows. We will be adding more examples in the future, so stay tuned.

## Other improvements

- The right sidebar in the workflow editor is now resizable, enhancing the editing experience
- Workflow validation now checks for slottable blocks missing a slot ID
- The React SDK has improved test coverage
- Websocket event handling in the React SDK has been optimized

## Bug fixes

- Removed extra bottom spacing when no footer buttons are present in built-in components
