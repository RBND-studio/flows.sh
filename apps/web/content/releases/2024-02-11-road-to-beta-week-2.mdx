**Tooltip overlay** - Draw attention to a specific element by highlighting it with an overlay.

**Flow error tracking** - see where flows fail and fix them. Error events show you where exactly the flow failed and on which element.

**Async load from Cloud** - to speed up the initialization even more, Flows now load only the first step of each flow. The other steps are loaded only when the flow starts.

**SDK TSDoc** - we didn’t forget about our developer friends. Now our SDK is fully documented, with comments and examples so you don’t need to check our docs for the basic stuff.

**CSS versioning** - to prevent breaking changes Flows Cloud now delivers the right version of CSS styles based on the SDK version in your codebase.
