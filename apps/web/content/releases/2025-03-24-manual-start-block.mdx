## Set state memory from SDK

You can now set the state memory value from the SDK by calling `setValue` function in the active block. We've also added more information about the memory configuration to the block properties. Learn more in [docs](/docs/react/reference#statememory).

## Other improvements

- Workflow environments dialog now shows the frequency next to the active version.

## SDK improvements

- Added workflow ID to active block response.
- Sped up exit node execution - now it doesn't wait for network requests to finish.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where the workflow editor could save a broken page targeting condition, resulting in the block never showing.
- Every block property now shows its description in the editor.
- Fixed a bug where the tooltip sometimes didn't render in the right place when showing on animated elements.
- Fixed modal overlay z-index sometimes not overlaying all elements.
