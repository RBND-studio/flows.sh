## More options for tour wait property

The tour wait property now includes "Element is on the page" and "Element is not on the page" conditions. These give you finer control over when a tour step should continue, based on whether specific elements are present in the page. See the updated [wait property documentation](/docs/block-properties/wait) for details.
