The flow editor should be now more user friendly and easier to use. We've added autosave, option to remove draft version, and improved the layout.

## Better start options

You can now specify more options when starting a flow. Apart from location and clicking on an element, you can now wait for input to change or a form to be submitted.

## Other improvements

- Project and organization switcher is now easier to use
- Billing limit now calculates expected usage
- localhost and 127.0.0.1 are now auto enabled in all projects to simplify testing
- Localhost events are not included in analytics and billing
