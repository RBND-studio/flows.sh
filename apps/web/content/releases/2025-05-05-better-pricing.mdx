In the spirit of fairness, we are changing our pricing model to match the actual value you get from Flows. Instead of charging for every user you send us, we now only charge for users who actually experience your workflows. This means if you have a large user base but only a portion see workflows, you’ll pay less.

## Pricing changes

We’re adjusting the free plan limit to 250 monthly tracked users (MTU). This change applies to all organizations on the free plan.

For paid plans, the free unit amount is also reduced to 250 MTU, but unit prices remain unchanged. This update applies only to new customers. Existing customers will keep their current free unit amount and unit prices as long as they remain on the same plan. If you cancel your plan, future subscriptions will use the pricing at the time of resubscription.

See our [pricing page](/pricing) for full details.

## Other improvements

- Invoices now show the MTU usage alongside the total amount.
