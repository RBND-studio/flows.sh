## Reset user progress

You can now reset the progress of users for specific flows or all flows. This feature is useful for testing onboarding or reintroducing onboarding to a specific user. Progress can be reset either from the Flows Cloud UI or via the SDK. [Learn more in our docs](/docs/project-setup/reset-user-progress).

## Links to documentation everywhere

To make creating great onboarding easier, we've added direct links to relevant documentation throughout the Flows Cloud UI. This should help you quickly find the information you need.

## Other improvements

- Added a [demo video](https://youtu.be/XY3eU_p0AW4?si=I-Kws9rhJ9RLak7Q) to the Getting Started guide.
- Fixed a bug where the SDK would select only the first matching element when waiting for a click, even if multiple elements matched.
- Updated the preview control panel to support multi-page applications.
