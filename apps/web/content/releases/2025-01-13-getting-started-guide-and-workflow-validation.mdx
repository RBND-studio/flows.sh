To make it easier for new users to get started with Flows, we've added a getting started guide that will walk you through the basic setup of Flows and creating your first workflow. The guide is powered by Flows and will be shown to everyone on their newly added Home page. We are planning to add more content to the Home page in the future, so stay tuned for more updates.

## Workflow validation

We've added basic workflow validation when publishing a new version of a workflow. Now you get warned when publishing a workflow without a start block or with a block that is not connected to anything. This should help you catch some common mistakes before they happen.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where when a step in a tour block was deleted out of sequence, no new steps could be added
- Fixed a few text overflow issues throughout the app
- Fixed a bug where clicking on sidebar links right after logging in would result in a broken state
