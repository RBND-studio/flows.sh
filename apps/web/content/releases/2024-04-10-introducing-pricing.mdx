Starting today, we are introducing pricing for Flows. Our pricing is simple and flexible. We want to make sure that Flows is accessible to everyone, no matter the size of your business.

That's why we are offering a generous free tier, so you can try Flows without any commitment. If you need more, we have a pay-as-you-go model that scales with your product starting at $0.009 per started flow. See our [pricing page](/pricing) for more details.

## Why price based on usage?

Its simple: charging a fixed fee or by Monthly Active Users (MAUs) results in unfair pricing for everyone. You may have a lot of users, but only a few of them need onboarding, or you may have a few users, but they need to be onboarded frequently. From value perspective, you shouldn't pay the same amount in both of these cases.
