When we started with Flows, our goal was to create a platform where product companies could build powerful onboarding experiences that feel truly native. In Flows 1.0, we followed the industry standard of floating elements layered on top of applications, paired with CSS customization. While this approach worked, it came with inherent limitations that restricted flexibility and the ability to deliver truly native-feeling experiences.

With Flows 2.0, we’ve taken inspiration from headless CMS systems. You provide the UI components and content, and we handle the underlying logic and user tracking. This enables you to create any native in-app experience you need, without the complexity of managing custom logic within your app.

## Features

### Workflows

Workflows allow you to build complex, multi-step experiences that can span multiple sessions or even the entire user lifecycle. These workflows go beyond traditional product tours, offering versatility and independence from the user’s current session.

### Tour

Tours are the familiar step-by-step guides that lead users through specific processes. They are ideal for linear tasks that need to be completed within a single session.

### Custom UI components

To maximize flexibility, Flows 2.0 introduces the ability to build and integrate your own UI
components directly within Flows. This feature allows you to craft fully custom experiences that
seamlessly blend with your app’s look and feel.

### Slottable components

Slottable (or embeddable) components enable you to dynamically embed elements directly into your application's UI, ensuring a truly native user experience.

### Other features

- **Segmentation**: Target specific users or companies based on their properties or behavior.
- **Analytics**: Gain insights into how users interact with your workflows.
- **Environments**: Safely test workflows on staging before deploying them to production.
- **Versioning**: Deploy, audit, and restore changes across environments.
- **Easy theming**: Use any theme provider or CSS solution for UI components.

## Pricing changes

With the launch of Flows 2.0, we’re updating our pricing model. We’re transitioning from a “Monthly Started Flows” model to a “Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)” model. This means you’ll pay based on the number of users that experience a workflow in a given month, with unlimited workflows included. For full details, visit our [pricing page](/pricing).

## How to migrate

Unfortunately, existing Flows cannot be automatically migrated to the new version. However, we’ve prepared a migration guide in our documentation to help you transition to Flows 2.0. If you have any questions or need assistance, our team is here to support you.

**The old version of Flows will be shut down on March 31, 2025**. Please ensure your Flows are migrated before this date. To ease the transition, Flows 1.0 usage will be free for everyone during this period.
