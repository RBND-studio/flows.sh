{/* TODO: rewrite this from progress to announcement */}

Over the past few months, we've been focused on shaping the future of Flows, which is why we didn't ship many things. But the exciting things we’ve planned should more than make up for it.

## Flows 2.0

While we’re not ready to share all the details just yet, we’ve spent our time defining what Flows 2.0 will look like. We believe that Flows should not be only about step-by-step guides but a platform where you can build any native in-app experience you need, without creating complex custom logic in your app.

What does that mean? Imagine you want to create a feature announcement, a survey, or a feedback form. With Flows, you should be able to do that by reusing your existing UI components and without writing any extra logic. You should be able to create these experiences in a visual editor, just like you create onboarding flows today.

The main concepts that will help us achieve this vision are:

- **Workflows:** A concept that evolves flows into something that allows you to create complex multi-step experiences that can span multiple sessions or even the entire user lifecycle (product tours can be a part of workflows).
- **Slottable components:** These will allow you to place UI component anywhere in your application using a simple slot mechanism. Just define your components, add slots to your app, and then create Workflows that dynamically fill these slots with your components as needed.

We’re excited about this new direction, and we can’t wait to share more details with you in the coming months.
