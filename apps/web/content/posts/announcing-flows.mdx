I'm excited to announce **Flows**: the next generation tool for creating onboarding flows and product tours.

Over the years, we've explored all the top players in this space. Be it Appcues, Intercom, Usetiful, IntroJS, you name it, we've tried it or at least looked into it. And we've always been left wanting more. More flexibility. More power. More control. More features. More everything (except a higher price).

The best solution we've found was taking IntroJS, customizing it, and integrating it with Mixpanel. It worked, but it took a lot of time and effort to get it right, and any change to the flows required a new release.

To bring the world of SaaS closer to a place where any software is easy to use and learn, we're setting out to innovate at this **learning layer** with Flows. Every day, millions of individuals sign up for SaaS products, and we're determined to help them get to the value quicker. The principles we use to build **Flows** are:

- **Speed:** Flows should be easy to create and deploy. There shouldn't be any dead time before an onboarding flow shows up to the user after a page loads.
- **Flexibility:**Â There shouldn't be any limits to what you can do with Flows. You should be able to create any experience you can imagine.
- **Reliability:** Flows should work every time. They should be robust and resilient to any changes in the underlying product.
- **Design:** Flows should have superior UX with beautiful UI. They should be a pleasure to create and a joy to experience.

We're still in the early stages of development, but we're making [great progress](https://github.com/RBND-studio/flows-cloud).The expected launch date is somewhere in **Q1 2024**. If you want to be notified when we launch, [join our waitlist](https://flows.sh/).
