Personalization lets you customize workflows based on user properties such as name, plan, or preferences. This makes it possible to create more relevant and contextual experiences across your product.

You can reference user data directly in content, or build dynamic URLs that include user specific values like an ID. This allows workflows to adapt to who the user is, not just where they are.
