We've completely overhauled Flows built-in UI components with new features, updated designs, and more flexibility. Meet Basics V2! The new components use new property types to give you more control over their appearance and behavior.

Buttons now support links and you can choose what happens when users click them. Modals have new size options and can be positioned anywhere on the screen. Tooltips and Hints are much nicer with the new styles. All components used in Tours now show a progress indicator so users know where they are and what’s left.

All examples and templates have been updated to use Basics V2. To get started, follow the [migration guide](/docs/component-libraries/basics-v2/overview#migration-from-basics-v1-to-basics-v2).

You can see the new components in action in the [Tour example](/examples/tour), or explore them in the [docs](/docs/component-libraries/basics-v2/overview).

PS: More components are on the way!

## Other improvements

- Added drag-and-drop reordering for properties in the component editor.
- Fixed an issue where the draft version of a workflow displayed an incorrect updated date.
