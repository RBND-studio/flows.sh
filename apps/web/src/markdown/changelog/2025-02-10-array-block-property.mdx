Create checklists or collections of useful links with the Array block property.

With arrays, you define a fixed structure that every item in your list follows. This is ideal for dynamic lists where each entry has consistent attributes like a title and a URL. To learn more about setting up and using the Array block property in your workflows, visit our [array block property documentation](/docs/blocks/block-properties/array).

This block property brings us one step closer to supporting onboarding checklists and hubs.

## Improved documentation

After the dust settled from the Flows 2.0 release, we took a step back to improve our documentation. We've restructured the content to make it easier to navigate and added more step by step guides to help you get started with Flows.

We also took the opportunity to switch from Nextra to Fumadocs, a more flexible and feature-rich documentation framework. This change will allow us to create better documentation that also looks great.

## Other improvements

- Added reset password functionality
- Adding blocks to the workflow is now faster
- When adding a new block, they will no longer hide an existing block
- String input in blocks now overflows to multiple lines, making it easier to edit long strings
- Improved how the number property input behaves when entering negative values

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where duplicate paths could sometimes be created when connecting blocks.
