You can now use the Floating checklist to guide users through tasks while keeping progress visible at all times. The checklist stays accessible across the product, helping users understand what to do next without interrupting their workflow.

Floating checklists are well suited for onboarding, setup flows, and longer product adoption journeys where users benefit from persistent guidance.

See the [Floating Checklist example](/examples/floating-checklist) or explore the [Floating Checklist documentation](/docs/blocks/basics-v2/floating-checklist) to get started.

## Other improvements

- Improved the docs layout and split content into clearer categories for easier navigation.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where updating block template properties could escape values from array properties.
- Fixed a bug where tour triggers were matched for every step instead of only the starting condition.
- Fixed an issue where double clicking a Hint trigger could result in unpredictable behavior.
