The Action property can now trigger other blocks, in addition to navigating to URLs and exit nodes. This makes it possible to start new flows, such as launching a tour, without exiting the current block.

This change enables more flexible workflows and allows complex experiences to be built without workarounds.

## Other improvements

- Separated the websocket app from the main backend service to improve scalability.
- Improved performance of the users page for organizations with large user counts.
- Added [installation guides](/docs/sdk) for multiple frameworks, including example projects.
- Added and improved debug logs in SDKs to make troubleshooting easier.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed the Debug panel not displaying correctly in Dark mode in some applications.
- Fixed an issue where waiting for an element on the page did not work correctly in certain scenarios.
