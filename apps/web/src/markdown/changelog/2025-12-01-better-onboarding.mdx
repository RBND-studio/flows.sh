Flows cannot be the **best** product adoption platform without a strong onboarding experience. In this release, we’ve focused on helping new users get started faster and with more confidence.

Every new organization now receives a step by step welcome flow that guides them through the initial setup. The flow ensures teams complete the key steps required to start building with Flows right away, without guessing what to do next.

## Other improvements

- Added a [Product Adoption Glossary](/glossary) covering key concepts and terminology.
- Improved security by sanitizing HTML in Basics V2 components to prevent XSS attacks.
- Applied multiple security improvements and dependency updates.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where links to our docs did not work correctly from the website.
- Fixed workflow status showing an incorrect state when no version was assigned to an environment.
