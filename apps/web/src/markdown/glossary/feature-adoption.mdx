## What is Feature Adoption?

Feature adoption is the process by which users discover, start using, and continue to use a specific feature of a product in a way that delivers value. Unlike overall product adoption, which focuses on whether users are succeeding with the product as a whole, feature adoption zooms in on individual capabilities and functionality.

In SaaS products, feature adoption helps teams understand which features users actually use, which ones drive value, and which ones are ignored or misunderstood.

## Why it matters

Shipping features doesn’t create value on its own. Value is only created when users adopt those features and integrate them into their workflows.

Strong feature adoption leads to:

- Higher overall [product adoption](/glossary/product-adoption)
- Better retention and lower [churn](/glossary/churn)
- Increased engagement and stickiness
- Higher expansion revenue from advanced or premium features
- Clearer product direction and roadmap decisions

Low feature adoption, on the other hand, often signals poor discoverability, unclear value, or friction in the user experience.

## How to measure Feature Adoption

Feature adoption is typically measured by tracking how many users use a specific feature and how often they return to it. The exact definition of “adoption” depends on the feature and the value it provides.

Common ways to measure feature adoption include:

- Feature adoption rate: Percentage of users who use a feature at least once.
- Repeated usage: Whether users come back to the feature over time.
- Time to feature adoption: How long it takes users to use a feature after signup or release.
- Adoption by segment: How adoption varies by role, plan, or cohort.
- Feature-level retention: Whether users who adopt the feature are more likely to stay.

A basic feature adoption rate can be calculated as:

**Feature Adoption Rate** = (Number of users who used the feature ÷ Total active users) × 100

Metrics to avoid include:

- Feature page views without interaction
- Hover or impression counts
- Clicks that don’t lead to meaningful outcomes

These metrics don’t indicate whether the feature is delivering real value.

## Examples

Examples of feature adoption events might include:

- Enabling a dark mode or accessibility setting
- Creating the first automation or rule
- Using an advanced filter or search
- Sharing a report or dashboard
- Connecting a third-party integration

For example, in a project management tool, creating the first automation rule may be a stronger signal of feature adoption than simply opening the automation settings.

To validate feature adoption, teams should measure how feature usage correlates with retention, engagement, or upgrades.

## Best practices

- Clearly communicate the value of new and existing features.
- Improve discoverability through [onboarding](/glossary/user-onboarding), tooltips, and in-app prompts.
- Guide users to features contextually, when they’re most relevant.
- Reduce friction and setup complexity for advanced features.
- Track feature adoption over time and by cohort to spot trends.
- Sunset or redesign features that consistently fail to gain adoption.

## FAQs

### How is feature adoption different from product adoption?

[Product adoption](/glossary/product-adoption) measures whether users are successfully using the product as a whole. Feature adoption focuses on whether users are discovering and using specific features. A user may adopt a product while never adopting many of its advanced features.

### What is a good feature adoption rate?

A “good” feature adoption rate depends on the feature’s purpose and target audience. Core features should have high adoption among most users, while advanced or niche features may only be adopted by specific segments. The key is whether the feature drives retention, engagement, or revenue for the users it’s intended for.

### How do you improve feature adoption?

Feature adoption improves when users understand why a feature matters and how to use it. To increase adoption:

- Introduce features during onboarding or at the right moment in the user journey.

- Use contextual in-app messages, checklists, and guides.
- Show examples, templates, or default configurations.
- Continuously test messaging, placement, and UX.

Tip: With [Flows](/) you can build contextual onboarding and in-app experiences that guide users to discover and adopt key features at the moment they’re most valuable.
