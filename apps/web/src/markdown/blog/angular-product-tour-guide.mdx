In this guide, you’ll learn how to build a product tour (sometimes called a user onboarding flow or product adoption guide) in your Angular application. Whether you’re using Angular CLI (with or without `@angular/ssr`), NX, or a custom setup, this guide will take you step by step through building a product tour in your Angular app.

## What are product tours?

A product tour is a guided in-app experience that helps users get familiar with your product when they first sign up or when new features are released. Typical tour elements include:

- **Tooltips** highlighting key UI elements
- **Modals** for step-by-step guidance or announcements
- **Hints** or hotspots drawing attention to important areas
- **Checklists** showing onboarding progress

With tours, users can learn your app on their own, cutting down support requests.

## Why product tours matter

Teams use product tours to:

- Accelerate new user onboarding
- Announce new features effectively
- Reduce support requests

Well designed tours can improve user activation, engagement, and feature adoption across your application.

## Core requirements for building a tour

Even a simple tour is made up of several key components:

- **UI elements**: tooltips, modals, hotspots, checklists
- **Content management**: stored in code or a database
- **User state tracking**: to remember what the user has seen

Additional needs often include:

- **Localization** for multiple languages
- **Analytics** for measuring completion and drop-offs
- **Segmentation** to show tours to relevant users
- **Custom UI components** to match your design system

Creating all this from scratch can become complex quickly.

### UI elements

In Angular, you have several options to create the UI for product tours. You can use dedicated packages like `ngx-joyride`, `shepherd.js`, `intro.js`, `driver.js`, or `nxg-ui-tour`, or use the components already in your design system (e.g. Dialog or Tooltip from `@angular/material`).

These libraries handle UI rendering, but they do not address content management, targeting, analytics, or state tracking, which are essential for production-ready tours.

### Managing tour content

Tour content includes text, labels, images, and links. If your product changes frequently, your tour will need updates too. To manage the content, you have two choices:

- Store content in your codebase - simple, but requires developer time for every small change.
- Store content in a database or CMS - better (and quicker) for teams where product, design, or marketing also contribute.

Many teams prefer letting non-engineering roles manage this content to avoid unnecessary interruptions and deployments.

### Tracking user progress

To prevent showing the same tour multiple times, store the user’s progress. Multi-step tours should allow users to resume where they left off.

You might be tempted to store user state in the browser’s local storage, but for any Angular app where users sign in (especially if they may use multiple devices) the state should be stored in your database instead.

To achieve all of this in-house, you will need to create API endpoints, a new database table (or column) to store the user state, and logic to decide when each tour should appear.

Without proper state management, users may see the same tour repeatedly, lose their progress, or never see the tour at all.

### Extra considerations

Depending on your product’s complexity, you may also need:

#### Localization

If you support multiple languages, your onboarding needs to be multilingual, increasing the complexity of the content management you need to build.

#### Analytics

Your product team will likely want to track the performance of each tour. For example:

- How many users started a tour
- How many completed it
- Where users drop off

To achieve this, you will need to create an integration into your existing analytics stack or build something from scratch.

#### Segmentation

As you introduce more tours, targeting the right users becomes essential. For example, you might want to show tours only to users who:

- Just signed up
- Signed up before a specific date
- Are not paying customers
- Are active during a time-limited promotion (e.g. Black Friday)

And again, most of these filters will be defined by non-engineering teammates who manage the product experience, and they’ll want to control them without needing developer involvement or deployments.

## Ship Angular product tours faster with Flows

All of the things above (UI, state, targeting, and analytics) can be handled quickly using Flows.

Plus, for UI elements, you don't need to use our built-in components (even though we think they are really good). You can bring your own Angular components directly from your design system. This gives you complete control to implement tours that meet your UI and UX requirements.

We built a fully customizable product adoption platform so you don't need to. Here’s how to use it to build your tour.

### Step 1: Installation

First, [sign up](https://app.flows.sh/signup), create and organization, and install the NPM package. Follow the [quick installation guide](/docs/frameworks/angular) to integrate `init()` into your Angular app. Once you have that set up, return here to continue.

### Step 2: Build the tour workflow

In the Flows dashboard, create a new workflow to define your tour’s logic and content:

1. Add a **Start** block - this determines how and which users enter the tour (you can adjust targeting later).
2. Add a **Tour** block - this is where the individual steps of your tour live.
3. Inside the Tour block, add your steps, for example:
   1. Modal
   2. Tooltip

To edit each step, click them in the Steps section and fill out their properties. You can update the title, body text, buttons, and other options that control how the components look and behave. If you prefer a step-by-step video, check out the one below.

### Step 3: Test your tour in staging

Once your steps are added, it’s time to test the tour. Set up a staging environment in **Settings > Environments**, then update the `environment` prop in `init()` to match the staging environment name.

<Image

  height={1040}
/>

Publish the workflow to the staging environment in Flows, then run your Angular app to see the tour in action. You may need to reload if your app was already running. For debugging, use the browser console or the SDK’s [debug mode](/docs/sdk-overview#debug-mode).

  alt="Screenshot of the publish dialog in Flows"

  height={1040}
/>

### Step 4: Go live with your tour

When you’re happy with the tour, deploy your Angular app with the `init()` integration and switch the `environment` prop back to `production`.

Afterwards, publish the workflow to production in Flows, and make sure to select the appropriate frequency (you can leave the migration option as is, this option is useful when republishing a workflow to let Flows know how to migrate the active users into the new version).

---

That’s it, you’ve successfully built a complete tour in Angular using Flows.

Instead of building UI, state, analytics, and content management from scratch, Flows handles it all. So you can focus on building your product, not maintaining onboarding infrastructure.

If you’re ready to ship better onboarding, faster, try Flows.
