      <>
        MTUs are the number of unique users that have been initialized in a given month. We count
        every users that has been initialized regardless if they have entered a workflow or not.
        <br />
        <br />
        If user is initialized multiple times in a month, they are only counted once. And if that
        user doesnâ€™t initialize the next month, they are not counted in your usage for that month.
