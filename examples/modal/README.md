# Modal – Flows example

This example showcases a modal powered by `@flows/react-components`.

Modals are useful to focus the user’s attention on just one thing. But since they are disruptive by design, only use them when necessary to avoid annoying your users.

Use modals to welcome new users to your app, announce major updates, or give users timely warnings and alerts.
