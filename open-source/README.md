## Philosophy

Our mission is to make software easier to use and learn. To do that, we are building tools that help product teams create better onboarding flows and product tours.

The principles we use to build **Flows** are:

- **Speed:** Flows should be easy to create and deploy. There shouldn't be any dead time before an onboarding flow shows up to the user after a page loads.
- **Flexibility:** There shouldn't be any limits to what you can do with Flows. You should be able to create any experience you can imagine.
- **Reliability:** Flows should work every time. They should be robust and resilient to any changes in the underlying product.
- **Design:** Flows should have superior UX with beautiful UI. They should be a pleasure to create and a joy to experience.
