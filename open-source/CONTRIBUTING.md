# Contributing to Flows

Contributions are welcome! We ❤️ contributions big and small.

## Submitting an issue

Spotted a bug? Do you have user feedback? Raise an issue in the repo. We will triage it and get back to you.

## Feature requests

Raise an issue for these and tag it as an Enhancement. We love every idea. Please give us as much context on the why as possible.

### Flows cloud Issues

Since Flows cloud code is not open source, we don't accept external PRs for it. But we do accept issues and feedback. If you don't see the code in this repo, it's most probably not open source.

### Web or Docs Issues

Web and Docs issues are fair game – we accept PRs for these.

## Creating a PR

Just create a new pull request if you want to make an update.

We recommend you create an issue if one doesn't already exist, and continue the conversation on the issue to get more info/alignment on what to build.
